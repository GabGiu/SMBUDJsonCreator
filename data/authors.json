It is made from organic, white cheddar cheese.<br /><br />2. These are shells, not macaroni.<br /><br />Point number one is very important. Not just because the cheese is organic (organic pastuerized milk, salt, enzymes), although that is very important to some people. No, it is mentioned here because some purists will eat only YELLOW cheddar cheese. White cheddar cheese makes white cheddar cheese sauce, and together they make something to eat with the color of white cheddar cheese. Therefore, this will look white--not snow white--but a soft creamy white, and some people (who will not be mentioned here) insist on yellow. Often this is a bright, unrealistic looking yellow, almost like it's radioactive, but I am not one to judge.<br /><br />The second thing to know is that the noodle-like things covered with the white cheddar cheese sauce are NOT macaroni. (As in \"stuck a feather in his hat and called it...\") These are \"shells.\" They resemble some sea shells, like the kind that Pagoo the hermit climbed into in that book, or like the rounded shells--only smaller--that you can put up to your ear and supposedly you can then hear almost anything, like even something happening in New York or France. Again, these are not macaroni, and this is important because there are some people who will eat only the little tubes known as macaroni.<br /><br />If you are OK with this, then you're in luck, and you don't need to look any further for a good lunch, dinner, or after play snack (or school, if you go to school). Annie's is like that other big company's product (Annie's is number two), where you boil and drain the macaroni (although here we have shells, NOT macaroni), and then mix in the dry sauce, maybe adding some milk or butter. \"Season to taste.\"<br /><br />The actual, official, ingredients include the following:<br />Organic Durum Semolina Pasta (Organic Durum Semolina, Water), Organic White Cheddar Cheese (Organic Cultured Pasteurized Milk, Salt, Enzymes), Whey, Salt. These are all vegetarian.<br /><br />One more thing is that for information, games, links to \"Arthur,\" and more about the company, visit www.annies.com. According to the website, Annie's is available in every state, and now has \"a product line that has grown to include 13 different varieties of totally natural macaroni and cheese, Annie's now makes five tasty pasta meals, four yummy canned macs, and a microwave macaroni and cheese...\" By the way, the name of the bunny on Annie's products is \"Bernie.\" I learned that on the website.", "dateOfBirth": "1998-08-22", "email": "Agnieszka.Lazarowska@hotmail.com"}, {"orcid": "0000-0002-8939-3255", "bio": "My cat absolutely loves this flavor.

The price was very good at the time for what seemed to be decent quality food for the price. It arrived super fast with Prime shipping. I was very impressed that the 15 pound bag had a very sturdy resealable zipper to help reduce the food going stale or needing to put it in a storage container.<br /><br />Unfortunately though, my cats would just not eat this food. I had bought it on a whim since money was tight and I was trying to save a few bucks. I filled up the self feeding container for the cats and they just would not touch it..the food just sat and sat, for literally a week. They had nibbled at it now and then, but did not eat as they do with their regular food. It was like they would eat just a few pieces and that was it.<br /><br />Luckily, one of the cats prefers wet food anyway, so she was still eating daily, but the other cat does not eat wet food and just refused to eat this Good Life Recipe. I was hoping she would come out of being stubborn, or would just get so hungry that she would eat it, but no such luck. I ended up buying our regular food after it was apparent that she would not eat this replacement.<br /><br />A few years back, when this cat food first came on the market, I had received a sample bag of it in the mail. At that time I had another cat who has since passed away, and he ate it just fine. I assume it has a particualr taste or smell that just does not appeal to certain cats. I will say that this food does have a strong smell and oddly enough it sort of reminds me of vomit. This could very well be the reason that some cats do not take to it.<br /><br />Since getting our regular cat food, I tried mixing it half and half with this Goodlife recipen so that I would not be wasting an entire 15lb bag, and the cats would still not eat it. I added more of the regular food, maybe 75/25 and now they seem to be eating it since there is more of the Iams than Goodlife.

Second, I noticed that unlike the other Thai teas, it does not have artificial coloring. All the other Thai teas I found on Amazon and in the Asian supermarket close by had FD&C Yellow No. 6 (Sunset Yellow) which is banned in a few countries due to its carcinogenic effects. I was hoping to avoid that by purchasing this alternative. Unfortunately, this tea is lacking more than just the artificial color.<br /><br />Since I always order tea at Thai restaurants due to the unique flavor and taste, but find the $3.00~4.00 price a bit expensive, I decided to get some so I could brew the same tea at home.<br /><br />THIS IS NOT THAT TEA. In fact, I wouldn't drink this tea at all. I've tried many different types of tea, and this tea is quite possibly of the same quality, if not worse, as \"cheap Chinese restaurant tea\" (watered-down jasmine). Not only does this tea fail to resemble the \"real\" Thai tea in any way, but it lacks any flavor, period. I found that I needed 2 tea bags for a typical, single 6-8oz serving of tea. Even so, it tasted more like generic black tea than the spicy, full-flavored Thai tea that you would expect. For a pot of tea, I needed 5-6 bags. Priced here at $7.99 per box, it is extremely overpriced. $8.00 for 20 bland, half-strength tea bags is a complete ripoff. You could literally get a box of 20 premium fair trade, organic tea bags from Trader Joe's for half the price that these bags are selling for.<br /><br />If you want authentic Thai tea, try <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005G0F8RY\">Thai Tea Cha Thai</a>. It is a little more expensive, but you receive a large bag and it actually tastes like what you would expect from \"Thai tea.\" Furthermore, with Cha Thai, a little goes a long way, so the bag should last a while. As I indicated above, it has Yellow No. 6, so I drink it in moderation until I can find a great-tasting, natural alternative that The Original Thai Tea fails to be.", "dateOfBirth": "1965-11-09", "email": "Ammar.Almomani@hotmail.it"}, {"orcid": "0000-0002-1497-5031", "bio": "The buttery popcorn flavor is just perfect.

The pellets (they can't be called in any way, shape, or form granules) are lightweight and of a comparable size/consistancy to Yesterday's News cat litter (or rabbit food pellets). Upon pouring the litter into the pan, waves of dust bourgened from the box.  Although the manufacturer describes the product as \"low in dust\", it is anything but.  In fact it's worse than many clay litters. The dust didn't end after the initial pouring either; every time the litter box was scooped, the waves of dust made a reappearance. My poor kitties must have a hard time breathing everytime they dig in this litter, and it's probably one reason why they dislike it so much.  The other likely being the consistancy. The litter does clump well, and the odor control is good, however trying to put myself in the cat's paws I had to pose the question; would I rather walk on a sandy beach, or a rocky one?  The answer is obvious; sand, of course. Hence, it's not a big surprise to find that the cats really do not like this product. There is also alot of tracking of the pellets outside the box due to their light weight and size.  In summation:<br /><br />Pros:<br /> - pleasantly mild woodsy-tea odor<br /> - clumps well<br /> - lightweight<br /><br />Cons:<br /> - hard pellet-sized litter that annoys felines to the point they avoid the box<br /> - high dust<br /> - high tracking<br /><br />If the manufacturer ever makes the pellets into smaller sand-like granules I'd be up for revisiting the product, but for now the cons far outweigh the pros for my household.

Two days ago my roommate had to lie on the floor of the animal hospital and cradle her Dalmatian Zoe as she felt Zoe's heart stop in her arms. She was in kidney failure from these treats I ordered for her on Amazon. Dont buy this. It's not an urban legend. It's very real and we can't get these companions back now.

As others have mentioned, the texture of the popped corn varies widely. Of four pre-portioned packages that we've popped so far, three produced stale, chewy popcorn.

Much more palatable results were produced using about half of the packaged amount. But by the time you're customizing the pour, the 'convenience' factor of these packages is shot. Not that they're very convenient, anyway - the 4 oz. portion was very difficult to transfer into our 4 oz. kettle. The bag is very big compared to the working space inside the heated kettle elements, and it's almost impossible to make popcorn without oil, salt, and kernels falling all over the place or dripping all over the bag.<br /><br />Considering the portion issues and difficulty of use, in the future I'll be buying the three components separately.

You can't go wrong and the best of all: excellent taste and quality, and for a pack of five this comes at a good value.<br /><br />Sometimes your diet will require you eat frequently and consciously, and in those cases you need to have a snack at hand when you get hungry, in order to keep your metabolism high all day long. In such cases finding a good and balance option could be hard. I love this 5-pack and I always have one at home an another pack at the office. I try to eat five or more times a day, so in my case having a healthy snack at hand wherever I am when I get hungry is a priority.<br /><br />Since you are checking this product I have to guess that you are probably a person that cares about what you eat, either because you are interested in losing weight, getting in better shape or just be healthier and keep in good shape, so I will share my own experience in the weight loss game and staying in shape game<br /><br />My own successful personal experience in weight loss is based on strategies to boost metabolism. Don't stress yourself, eat frequently, eat just what you need each time, and choose wisely what you are going to eat, supplement your diet. Yet simple and it works. I loss more than 200 lbs and shrink my waist (from 44 to 32), and I have been able to keep in good shape since then. Every single aspect of my life has improved since then.<br /><br />Keep in mind that a good diet is just part of the equation, you also need a plan that helps you keep on track and monitor your condition. Based on my own personal experience I can recommend some tools that you may want to consider, to establish your own strategies for boosting your metabolism, loosing weight, and even more important keeping that weight off. They are:<br /><br />- \"Ultrametabolism: The Simple Plan for Automatic Weight Loss\" by Mark Hyman. A practical an realistic plan for weigh loss.<br /><br />- \"The ABS Diet\", which is another very practical, readable, insightful, and inspirational book, that also includes an exercise plan.<br /><br />- A Body Fat Monitor or Scale. This will help you monitor your progress, to assure that the weight you are loosing is fat (fat lost = increased metabolism) and not muscle, water or bone mass (decreased metabolism).<br /><br />- A Heart Rate Monitor Wrist Watch. This is an excellent tool that will help you monitor and control your Heart Rate in order to keep yourself in a burning fat state (increased metabolism).<br /><br />- \"Heart Monitor Training for the Complete Idiot\", a primer on the use of Heart Rate Monitors for health improvement or weight control.<br /><br />If you want to star focusing only on your diet, the first two may be worth considering. If you exercise, or want to start doing it right, the last threee are for you. If you do both, all the recommended options can improve your results.<br /><br />I am 39 years old, With the help of the tools I just mentioned not only I went fro size 44 to size 32 pants, but also obtained substantial benefits that included weight control, cardiovascular improvements, lowered blood pressure, and improved muscular-skeletal strength and flexibility, but also the myriad of mental and psychological benefits derived from being in the best shape of my life.", "dateOfBirth": "1960-08-16", "email": "Anna.Hoffmann@yahoo.it"}, {"orcid": "0000-0002-2041-9453", "bio": "On the good side it helps me with nighttime leg cramps.<br />On the bad side it gives me diarrhea.<br />Trying to change the amount to see if I can lessen the bad results...", "dateOfBirth": "1958-07-13", "email": "Anna.Kruspe@hotmail.com"}, {"orcid": "0000-0003-3958-267X", "bio": "Nutiva Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil is a great value for the money!!

So it came as no surprise to me that this movie was both warped and hilariously funny.<br /><br />Adam and Barbara Maitland (Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis) are a charming young couple that live in a large old house on the edge of a small town. They love each other very much, very playful and fun together, and have just settled in for three weeks of vacation to work on their hobby: a scale model of the entire town. It's really good, too. Also, apparently they renovated the old house themselves.<br /><br />One day they went into town to get some supplies for the model and on the way home, went through a covered bridge. That is, through the side of the covered bridge into the river. They found themselves back at home, but eventually realized that they had died and were now haunting the place. That would be OK, except that their neighbor, a real estate agent, promptly sold the place to the Deetz, a severely dysfunctional family from the city. In no time at all, the wife has thrown out all the comfortable old things Adam and Barbara had, and put in horrible modern junk based on the dreadful tastes of her friend, an interior decorator. Also on her own sculptures, which are arguably the ugliest things you have ever seen produced by anyone over the age of five.<br /><br />The only redeeming aspect of the Deetz family is their teenage daughter Lydia (Winona Ryder). She dresses in black, is very morbid, but also is the only one able to see Adam and Barbara. And she is in sympathy with their assessment of her step-mother's horrible taste. Also horrible attitude.<br /><br />They don't quite know what to do, but when they returned to the house after the accident (actually, I think it was after the funeral), they found a book titled \"Guidebook for the Recently Deceased.\" They tried to read it, but there was no index, and it didn't seem to make a lot of sense to them. They did manage to draw a door through to a bureaucratic nightmare where they were told to talk to their caseworker. Turns out their caseworker is an abrupt, shriveled old woman who smokes constantly and the smoke seeps out through a large slash in her neck. She warns them not to contact Beetlejuice, who used to be her assistant but \"went out on his own.\" He had left an advertisement in their handbook, and for good measure, managed to put one on their TV.<br /><br />Still, when Lydia reads their handbook and does all she can to help them, they still haven't gotten rid of the Deetz family. In desperation, they call on Beetlejuice (Michael Keaton). You have to say his name three times to call him, which suggestions that he is a demon. Actually, I think the suggestion is also made that he's an alien. It's hard to be sure.<br /><br />The funniest parts of the movie are Beetlejuice's attempts to frighten the Deetz away: or at least the parents. He likes Lydia, and in fact wants her to marry him.<br /><br />There are lots and lots of inside-joke type references throughout, especially in the underworld bureaucracy.

I even used to make my own when I was younger. I've tried a variety of brands before but this is the first time trying out Wild Ride. It claims to be Hormone and Nitrate free with no added MSG, and while the ingredients listed do confirm their claims this beef jerky has got to be some of the driest, tasteless I have ever eaten.<br /><br />Kickin' Teriyaki is the flavor I got. To be sure I didn't just get a bad package I opened two bags and both sets of jerky was dry and tasteless. I do not taste anything \"kickin\" about this jerky and there is virtually no Teriyaki flavor either. To make things worse the dry jerky tends to have a powdery taste to it because it is made with Soy Sauce POWDER instead of Soy Sauce (this is to get around saying it has no added MSG). Instead of imparting a nice Teriyaki flavor you get this powedery taste to the jerky and mixed with the bit of onion and corn starch in the jerky, it almost is like they coated it with onion powder instead of Teriyaki.<br /><br />On the plus side however, this is a nitrate free product which is a good thing as many other jerkies tend to have Sodium Nitrate in them. Also with both packages I have opened currently, the jerky breaks down easily and isn't tough as leather nor does it contain any sinew it seems.<br /><br />OVERALL this jerky just seems extremely tasteless and powdery. While it doesn't contain \"added\" MSG, Nitrates or hormones, they got around this by using powdered versions of ingredients (powdered vinegar and soy sauce) plus it contains Dextrose and Fructose , modified food starch and corn starch and SUGAR is your second ingredient. I've never seen so much sugar and starch added to jerky in my life.

More than enough salt to share with friends or family if you don't want to keep it around for years, as you will likely not use it all before the date printed on the package.<br /><br />I'm using coconut oil and Flavacol as many posters have suggested.  This combo makes GREAT popcorn!  On the stovetop, I'm heating the oil, adding the Flavorcol, then the kernels. It's popping up fluffy and yellow.  Great smell and great taste.  Then I bought a West Bend Stir Crazy, adding the salt to the oil as some reviewiers suggested.

It is still great.<br /><br />Couple of tips:<br /><br />1) The package lists recommended amount of product for the amount of popcorn you're making.  Remember, this product is basically salt with artificial flavor and color added, so preferences will vary. Start with the recommended amount on the package and experiment. Just remember, you can always add more if not salty enough, but your batch is ruined if you use too much.<br /><br />2) I use a dredge (shaker) for easier dispensing.

I don't know if it was available everywhere, but it was always at the local A&P in my town, and I came to like it better than any of the fancy grated Parmesan or Romano cheeses.  It came in the very same 3 oz containers like here on Amazon.  Something of a pain for I liked it so much I didn't care how much it cost, I just wanted it all the time. (It would have been nice if it came in larger sizes). There was simply nothing like its flavor on pasta.  It was easily distinguishable by its yellow/orange color, and its much tangier, richer cheese taste.  My father, along with many others considered it junk compared to grated Parmesans, but I didn't really care what was in it.  I only knew it gave pasta a whole new flavor that was as deliciously cheesy in a grated form that was available.  A long time ago it disappeared from many local stores.  My father used to tell me that they stopped making it because only two people would buy it.  Me, and the guy that invented the stuff.  But according to the reviews here I see I am not alone.  This product is essentially the same thing as the grated american cheese of my youth in the very same small 3 oz containers.  And I am happy to report that it is just as fabulously delicious as I remember it.  Ordering 12 at once will not see it go bad here.  We have spaghetti at least once in a week in my house and I load it with this stuff.  I am a self confessed grated cheese fiend, but nothing compares to this  topping in my opinion.  It's not pure, it's not really healthy, it's not aged all that much, it's just plain delicious.  It can  be compared to chomping down a hot dog smothered with mustard and ketchup and enjoying it immensely, and someone telling you there is no real food in it, or good for you. You don't eat hot dogs everyday, and you won't eat this that often either.  If you like grated cheese like I do, I would strongly urge you to try this grated american cheese product.  Its the most flavorful grated cheese topping around, and I recommend it.  My only reason for taking one star off is the price.  With shipping its a little pricey, but still worth every cent.

I wonder why Soriano was chosen to do the music and not Vargas himself but it's all good. Soriano is a very good guitarist and songwriter, but like many bachata singers he falls into the trap of sounding like 50% of every other bachatero out there.

Even Luis Vargas has a wider repotoire, but then again, this is the only album I've heard by Soriano. I appreciate this album and want to give it 4 stars, but it really deserves less. The songs are very good and he has a bright future as a bachatero, I like that he is one of the lesser known bachata singers/songwriters. Many Dominican friends of mine have never even heard of him, including my wife who is Dominiana. But alot of people had never heard Juan Luis Guerra before \"Bachata Rosa.\" This is not Soriano's \"Bachata Rosa\" however. Antony Santos may be \"El Rey\"( The King of Bachata ) but if Yoan keeps up the good songwriting and fluid guitar pickings, we may see a new contender. Santos is known for being a monster guitar plucker in the bachata style. True Soriano sounds like alot of other bachata out there, but he also is BETTER than the other 50% out there.

I thought it added fine notes of flavors, and I would use it again for this exact purpose.  I like most of the flavors and textures this sauce brings.<br /><br />PROBLEM<br /><br />But I don't detect much jalape&ntilde;o flavor, which is one of my favorites, and which is why I chose this to begin with.<br /><br />===== Which is why I subtract ONE STAR.<br /><br />SOLUTION<br /><br />Using the nearest blade, I simply chopped up a few slices from a jar of jalape&ntilde;os (using the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00093090Y\">Victorinox 47547 10-1/4-Inch Wavy Bread Knife, Black Fibrox Handle</a>), dumped them and a little bit of the jar's juice into the bottle, and gave it a pretty sincere shaking.  Voila.<br /><br />I ordered this product rather than some similar one for a secondary purpose, which is to make the following point, which I insist you not only read carefully but also find interesting.<br /><br />As you know, the word jalape&ntilde;os is properly pronounced as follows:<br /><br />hall aah PAY nyos.  But I have heard it pronounced, and you might too, as follows:<br /><br />jal uh PEE nuhz.<br /><br />This is a remarkably poor pronunciation, and I think it might set some sort of record for the greatest density of mistakes.<br /><br />1.  It's h, not j.<br />2.  It's all, not Al.<br />3.  It's aah, not uh.<br />4.  It's pay, not pee.<br />5.  It's ny, not n.<br />6.  It's os, not us.<br />7.  And it's os, not ohz.<br /><br />That's nearly 2 mistakes per syllable, or one every 1.3 letters in only 9 letters.  Can you think of a word that is more severely mispronounced?<br /><br />===== For this I subtract TWO MORE STARS from the product.<br /><br />Although it is not my choice as a substitute for picante sauce on a taco or pretty much any Mexican food, that's just my personal preference.  It does make a striking salad dressing, and it can be used as a base for a dipping sauce for tortillo chips or the like.  And I like a little mixed into mashed potatoes or a topping for a baked potato, but again that's just me.<br /><br />I tried other applications just for this Amazon review, and here are the results.<br /><br />-- Drizzled onto a pumpkin pie<br /><br />This turned out to be just awful.  The flavors of a well-made pumpkin pie are not only not enhanced by the addition of this sauce on top of it, they are positively worsened, especially when compared to the use of a substance such as, say, whipped cream.  If you are thinking of duplicating this test just to make sure I'm not merely making this up, I recommend that you drizzle the sauce onto the top of a single slice and not the whole entire pumpkin pie as I did, just in case you get the same result and wish you hadn't.<br /><br />-- As a substitute for vermouth in a classic straight-up gin martini<br /><br />This result also was ghastly.  Whoever perfected the first classic martini did a good thing for the dlrow of people who like the classic martini, or the fourth one, as the case may be in your time zone.  Whoever thought of using Taco Bell Bold & Creamy Jalape&ntilde;o Sauce instead of vermouth made, in my opinion, a grievous mistake.  Another griebous mistake is to make a whole batch of martinish this way instead of just one.  Live and learn, though, right?<br /><br />-- Sunblock<br /><br />This is a closer call, so let me list the pros and the cons.  The best argument in favor of using this sauce as a substitute for any of the regular, purpose-made sunblock lotions that are approved by The United States FDA and are available in many convenient stores is that it does work in the sense that whereever you have it slathered on thick enough, it will surely reduce the harmful effects of the sun's ultraviolet-range radiation on your skin, I would think, to some extent or other.  I am not inclined to test the exact SPF value of this sauce under the many exact various circumstances such as Hawaii unless YUM Brands wants to fund the research!<br /><br />As a sunblock Taco Bell Bold & Creamy Jalape&ntilde;o Sauce does suffer from a number of problems.  One is that it slides off of pretty much any part of you that isn't bowl-shaped or at least flat and horizontal in your particular bodily configuration when it's applied.  For example, if you're lying supine you can pop open the top, which is handily hinged, and squeeze out some of this particular sauce (I have the eight-ounce size) into your navel and have a fair chance it will provide some degree or other of protection to the skin thereunder, assuming you have an innie.<br /><br />Another drawback is that no one -- at least no one I asked over a period of dozens of hours spread out over several weeks at various pools and beaches this summer -- seems to want to help you apply this exact sauce to your back.<br /><br />A third con to this optional sunblock use is that in the hot sun this sauce reeks out a noisome aroma within a three-foot radius that is not only not nearly as pleasant as the reminiscigential smell of suntan lotion, it is decidedly worse than neutral.  In fact, I think I'd rather smell three feet.<br /><br />I don't know about you, but when I balance the pros and the cons I weigh the sunblock cons more heavily.<br /><br />===== So, because of its failure as a substitute for whipped cream and vermouth and sunblock lotion, I subtract YET 1 MORE STAR.<br /><br />SUMMARY<br /><br />If you like a little jalape&ntilde;o flavor in this type of sauce, buy this product.

I can remember as a child that my parents always bought maple syrup (rather than the imitation stuff now made from corn syrup), so I grew up with it.  And I have occasionally splurged at the grocery and bought a small bottle, just as a reminder of how things used to be.  However, my kids grew up with Log Cabin, Aunt Jemima, Mrs. Butterworth's, etc., which are products that have never been close to a maple tree or anything else remotely organic.  However, when my kids have tried the \"real stuff\" they were unimpressed.  But as the Cooks Illustrated article points out, most grocery store maple syrup is Grade A.  So I wanted to see just how different Grade B syrup is from its better-selling sibling.  Wow!  I was stunned by how good that Highland Sugarworks syrup tastes - it is intense and complex, and I think far better than any syrup I have ever used.  Both of my kids agree, and now refuse to touch the stuff based on corn syrup.  Of course, now I have two big bottles of corn syrup-based pancake topping I bought at Costco that are not going to be consumed.  Maybe I can donate them to the next Pancake Breakfast fund-raiser held at my church?  But it is clear neither of my kids will be touching it, now that they have tried honest-to-God maple syrup, made the way it is supposed to be, from trees!

They are lower in sugar than most breakfast bars or even yogurts at 13 grams, and although the fat content is a bit high (8 grams), there is only a trace of saturated fat (.5 grams).<br /><br />But, the best part about these biscuits is the taste--they are quite yummy!  I as glad that the Apple Cinnamon shares the same crisp, buttery, cookie-like flavor as the Blueberry.  Unfortunately, unlike the Blueberry, which actually has little bits of berries and a distinct blueberry flavor, the Apple Cinnamon variety did not taste particularly apple-y to me at all, and I could not detect any pieces of fruit.  The base flavor was still good, but it was more like a plain butter cookie rather than the promised Apple Cinnamon.<br /><br />I will probably continue to buy the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005VBBSVI\">Belvita Blueberry</a> when available, but this might be an option for those who prefer a simpler flavor.", "dateOfBirth": "1982-02-21", "email": "Dale.Miller@gmail.com"}, {"orcid": "0000-0002-6545-0905", "bio": "I like some of the other Go Raw items but the Pizza Flax Snax were just not good.

This is much better than having GIANT whole almonds sticking out of the chocolate like some brands.  You are guaranteed to taste almonds in every bite.<br /><br />The absolute best part about these bars is that they do not contain soy, dairy or wheat as ingredients. It is fairly easy to find chocolate without wheat, pretty hard to find chocolate without dairy, and almost impossible to find chocolate without Soy Lechithin in it.

In my experience sport drinks or energy drinks are either too overpowering in their taste, or have an unpleasant \"medicine\"-like aftertaste, especially if they are low in calories. This energy-burning drink has none of those characteristics. The taste of raspberry is very obvious, but not overpowering. The drink is not as heavy as a fruit juice though, and hence much more suitable as a light refreshment. The fact that it is not carbonated is also a plus, as it will not leave you feeling bloated. This is especially important if you are drinking it during or before a workout. I cannot ascertain how effective this drink is in terms of burning calories (they claim that one can burns up to 100 calories), but it sure did energize me and gave me an extra jolt. In that respect it is probably no better than any other caffeinated beverage. However, this drink is flavored with an artificial sweetener, which to me is not the best of an idea for a supplement that is designed to supposedly burn calories. Recent research has shown that artificial sweeteners actually have the opposite effect from the one that they are designed for - our bodies adjust to misinterpreting the sweetness to be associated with low calories, so we end up retaining more energy from \"regularly\" sweetened products.<br /><br />The shape of these cans is also convenient for storage or transport.

Glad I did! They are delicious!<br /><br />The first bite was strange because we didn't know what to expect. They are only slightly sweet (from the coconut nectar), with a tart/bitter hint (probably mostly from the cacao). Because the cashews are dehydrated after they are soaked in the coconut nectar, these are not at all chewy, like a mainstream \"cluster\" might be. Personally, I do not like chewy, so this is a good thing. Consecutive bites got more and more delicious as we knew what to expect. They are VERY TASTY, but not in that \"addictive\" way where you crave them and unconsciously eat the whole box and then feel awful afterward. I think it's because the taste is full and satisfying and they fulfill a nutritional need that the body and mind feel satisfied after a single serving. Just my guess. I still wouldn't leave the box open and eat from it, though (after all, they are really good!); so, pouring out an appropriate amount into a small bowl also helps keep snacking in check!<br /><br />The box says the cashews are truly raw and even explains how some \"raw\" cashews are not really raw and that the term is often used simply to differentiate from roasted cashews, even when the product claimed to be raw has been cooked or boiled, mostly for shell removal. Really raw cashews (sometimes called \"truly raw\") are supposedly best for you because they retain their healthy nutritional profile and the enzymes are not killed off in the heat. In my experience, these are also more difficult to find and are somewhat more expensive than just mainstream raw cashews.<br /><br />The cashews are mostly in small bits and large pieces, interspersed with a well-balanced amount of organic cacao nibs. Many clusters are nicely-sized, about an inch+ in diameter. Because they are not chewy, this size is a good size for snacking. There are also many itty bits of cashews and separated cacao nibs in the bottom. This can be used as a dessert topping or simply scooped up and eaten, in hand.<br /><br />It is believed that the whole cashew is better than the cashew in pieces, because less oxidation can occur in the whole cashew (less surface area to oxidize). But, realistically, this is eaten as more of a healthful snack than the main part of a healthful meal, so, as long as you are getting good nutrients elsewhere, this will serve as a nice compliment to that.<br /><br />Note: a cotyledon is defined as the first leaf of a seedling (I had to look it up).

Three months ago she was in crisis and I was sure she would die.  I read all I could about CRF and the Wysong Au Jus recipe was on a comprehensive list of low solium and low phosphorus foods.  I bought some and could not believe my good fortune when she ate it up.  I know now what triggered the crisis episode - it was the solium in a small amount of ham I gave her as a treat.  I k ow this because  after she was back on her feet and doing great eating Au Jus one night  I let her lick the tiniest amount of spaghetti sauce from my bowl and the next couple of days I could tell she felt bad.  She loves spaghetti sauce and I never considered the high sodium content in it plus it was a tiny bit but it had a big negative impact on her.  So I learned my lesson and she has not had any critical setbacks.  She still has the disease of course and it is apparent.  She drinks a lot of water and she sleeps more than she used to.  Some days she is very quiet but some days she is loud and rambunctious.  And she still  keeps herself clean.  So there is  a quality life there in that little rascal of mine and I truly believe the Au Jus food is why.  Just to keep things interesting for her I keep chunk light tuna in water (nothing on the ingredients list but tuna, water) and Gerber baby food - beef, chicken, and turkey varieties.  It is meat, water, and cornstarch, nothing else.  Mainly she eats the Au Jus but now and then I give her one of the others to keep her from getting bored, which she tends to do.

While it is less unhealthy than other sugary jams, I don't deceive myself that it won't raise blood sugar, because it is essentially 100% fructose, which is just as capable of raising blood sugar as sucrose (white/table sugar)--more on this below.<br /><br />Most people buy this product as a presumed health food due to it being lower in sugar than other jams. It's ingredients are: \"Juice concentrate (pear, grape), strawberries, maltodextrin (dietary fiber), fruit pectin, citric acid, natural flavor.\" This product contains no artificial sweeteners, which are associated with various health hazards.<br /><br />This product's primary claim to fame is that it is, as the label states, \"sweetened only with fruit juice.\" Any jam will have its sweetener listed first, meaning that is its primary ingredient. If you are on a low-carb diet or diabetic, you might want to know that this jam basically substitutes fructose for sucrose. Since fructose is twice as sweet as sucrose, the producers only need to use half as much as they would have of sucrose, so it has about half the calories of regular jam. (On the other hand, many cheap jams contain high-fructose corn syrup--but that's another health issue entirely.) The problem for many people is that they are used to the taste of sucrose, and 100% fructose tastes very different from a combination of fructose and sucrose which is the case with regular jam made with white sugar. To my own taste, since I'm eating a fruit spread, it tastes quite sweet enough to me.<br /><br />The fruit pectin in this product is a standard thickener in jellies and jams and its own natural form of fiber, so I am not sure why the company decided to add in maltodextrin and call that \"fiber\" too. Anyone with a gluten intolerance should be wary of this product because of the maltodextrin since some people with gluten intolerance are getting sick from the maltodextrin in this jam. The producers claim on the label it is \"gluten-free,\" but maltodextrin can be made from either wheat or corn, and apparently this company is not being careful enough about contamination with gluten.<br /><br />Another ingredient that is problematic as to how healthy this product can be is the \"natural flavor.\" It is possible that the producers add a strawberry extract so they can get away with using less real strawberries, which are more expensive than a flavoring. The definition of natural flavor under the Code of Federal Regulations is: \"The essential oil, oleoresin, essence or extractive, protein hydrolysate, distillate, or any product of roasting, heating or enzymolysis, which contains the flavoring constituents derived from a spice, fruit or fruit juice, vegetable or vegetable juice, edible yeast, herb, bark, bud, root, leaf or similar plant material, meat, seafood, poultry, eggs, dairy products, or fermentation products thereof, whose significant function in food is flavoring rather than nutritional\" (21CFR101.22). That essentially means that natural flavor is derived from a real food, but the process by which it is derived is unexplained and there is no way to know how safe or healthy a natural flavoring is.", "dateOfBirth": "1990-09-05", "email": "Diana.Nurbakova@yahoo.com"}, {"orcid": "0000-0001-8563-8123", "bio": "I hate to say it, but lately my dogs are having problems with their bowels.

My kids had been dying to try this stuff ever since they had come across it on J-Box, the popular Japanese import webshop. Ramune is incredibly popular in it's native Japan, and now it looks like the fun is beginning to spread here in the States.<br /><br />To open a bottle of Ramune, you have to remove the top, pop out this little plastic plunger from it's casing, and then use the plunger to pop out a marble that seals the neck of the bottle. The neck of the bottle has two indentions that will hold the marble when you tip the bottle back to drink from it, keeping the neck of the bottle clear. Hold the bottle the wrong way, and the marble will clog things up. You can avoid carbonated overflow when opening by pressing gently on the plunger until it depresses the marble; knock it down with force and you're sure to get a fountain of spray.<br /><br />The original flavor reviewed here tastes a lot like Sprite, but Ramune also comes in several other flavors. It uses high fructose corn syrup and/or cane sugar as a sweetener (It lists both on the label, which usually means that it uses whatever is cheapest on the world market at the time of bottling. Listing both also means that they don't have to change their labeling every time they change sweetener.)<br /><br />This is a way fun product that kids (and most adults) will have a blast with. It's a smaller portion (8 ounces) than what we're used to here in the US, but that actually works out for us as we're trying to limit the amount of soda that our kids consume. Ramune works great as an occasional soda treat and the fun factor alone keeps us coming back for more. Ramune is easy to find at just about any Asian market, but for those who don't have easy access to one, ordering here on Amazon would be recommended. A 6-pack of Ramune will run you about $6.99 to $7.99 in most Asian markets.<br /><br />Also, for the safety conscious, I can attest that these drinks are very safe. We've never had a problem with the marble, and I can't find any reports on the internet that would indicate any safety concerns with this drink. It's not a choking hazard, in other words.

I'm not mad at the product, it's still delicious; but when I got the package I ordered from Amazon.com, it had been through a lot.  It was smashed on one side, and sure enough, 3 of the sodas were ruined, had exploded all over the other sodas, and many had been deformed due to some horrific accident.  Amazon... I have never had such a horrible problem from you before, but this is my first food purchase.  It makes me very unlikely to order another food ESPECIALLY beverage package again, and I'm a pretty frequent customer.  I wish you would make it right.  I realize it may have been the mail carrier, but perhaps Amazon needs to package the beverages better or put a Fragile sign on it or something.  Just a suggestion.

My best guess is that it's somebody who wants to appear healthy and \"drinks water\" but doesn't actually like the flavorless quality of water. Like bottled flavored water beverages, this product adds flavor with no calories.<br /><br />But in the process, it adds chemical ingredients to your water. Propylene glycol, sucralose (artificial sweetener) and acesulfame potassium (also noted as a sweetener). I'm not saying any of these, in the quantities ingested using this product, are bad...but it seems odd to me to take water and add something to it that contains chemicals.<br /><br />The benefit is that you get flavoring without any calories. Does this product taste like \"sweet tea\"? Yes, it does. I've been using it for over a week about once a day, and I would say it tastes like sweet tea. However, I've noticed a mild \"alcohol\" scent from it (probably the popylene glycol). The scent is very similar to that of any \"extract\" you probably have in your baking cabinet, like vanilla extract.<br /><br />The flavor is sweet without being incredibly artificial, due to no real sugar being in the product. The color is dead-on \"tea\" -- it's the right shade of brown, and just like tea, if you want more flavor and squeeze more of this into your water, it will get darker. It's an interesting concept.<br /><br />So what you end up with is a sweet-tea-flavored water...which lacks all of the benefits of actually drinking tea. Tea, after all, is healthy for you. There's no caffeine in this product and no sugar, so it doesn't offer any type of energy boost.<br /><br />It's artificial in every sense of the word.<br /><br />Personally, this isn't something I would use long-term.

If I also get good reviews for the tea itself from the recipients, I'll post an update.<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />I'm a little disappointed; I think the term \"tea chest\" made me picture something more luxurious than this product turned out to be.  It's not bad-looking, but I think this is a case of getting exactly what I paid for - this tea chest and its contents look and feel like a $25 gift.  It's a shame, because I think that this could be exactly what I was expecting if more attention had been paid to finishing.  As it is, though, I think I will probably be looking elsewhere if I ever decide to buy another tea chest.  I'm giving it three stars - I don't feel ripped off, but I don't feel like I've gotten away with anything, either.<br /><br />Details:<br /><br />The chest dimensions are 11 3/4\" L X 9 3/8\" W X 2 3/8' H.  The chest comes shrink-wrapped in clear plastic, with a nutrition label stuck to the underside of the chest itself.  I didn't try peeling off the label because I was afraid of pulling up some of the finish or making the wood splinter.  It's a very lightweight, soft wood - the sides are about 1/4\" thick and the top is around 1/16\" thick.  The chest is a red mahogany color on the outside only.  The hardware (hinges and a hasp-type closure) are silver-toned and also of a lightweight material.<br /><br />The box itself, I don't find very attractive.  I like the color of the stain, and the construction seems sturdy enough (hardware is attached with screws, joins are straight and secure, although I can't tell if there's anything besides glue involved), but the finishing isn't very craftsmanlike:<br /><br />- The surface has dark-colored particles stuck to it, which makes me think they stained this without wiping it down after sanding.<br />- There's some slight drips of stain visible on the sides of the box.<br />- The finish is not very lustrous.<br />- There are splinters around the indentations for the box's hinges - although on the plus side, they did at least make indentations for the hinges.<br />- The hasp is slightly misaligned, so when you flip the hinged part on the lid down, it doesn't slide easily over the catch on the bottom half and you have to force it a little to get it closed.<br />- I have all sorts of issues with the lid: it has light scratching on it that looks like it got a few swipes of a medium-grade sandpaper and that's it; it's for some reason really dusty-looking and I can't seem to get it clean by just wiping it; and it's stenciled with the Wissotzky Tea logo in a slightly metallic gray paint.<br />- That logo - I don't know why, but the logo design, and the design of the tea bag wrappers, does not give the impression of luxury or indulgence.<br /><br />Ironically, the sides and bottom of the box are a little nicer-looking than the lid; they're slightly more lustrous, not as covered with sanding grit, and you can see some wood grain.<br /><br />There's an insert to divide the box into nine slots for tea bags; it's a very lightweight wood, glued together but not attached to the box interior.  The sanding on the insert also seems incomplete (or not done at all).  The interior of the box is unlined, unstained wood.<br /><br />A big plus is that when you open the box, it smells *delicious*.<br /><br />To be honest, if I knew what the box would be like before I had ordered this, I would have kept looking.  Now that I've got it, though, I'll go ahead and give it to its intended recipients - the helpful and friendly staff of an office I frequent, whom I wanted to remember for the holidays even though my budget's limited.  But if I had gotten this for someone as a more personal gesture, or if it had been for someone I was trying to impress (i.e. boss, client, mother-in-law-to-be, etc), I'd probably be putting this aside and looking elsewhere for an alternative.<br /><br />1/30/2011 - The girls at the office all love the tea!  But I still wouldn't necessarily recommend this chest as a gift - you can buy Wissotzky tea for around $3 a box right here on Amazon.

Instead, I came across this brand while shopping in my grocery store organic food isle. Since then, I have eschewed all other brands of spaghetti for Mrs. Leeper's Wheat/Gluten Free Organic Spaghetti. Here is why:<br /><br />1) I find it more filling then \"regular\" spaghetti. Typically, pasta leaves me craving more pasta. Not so with Mrs. Leeper's.<br />2) Tastes like the real McCoy.<br />3) Can be frozen after cooking. I boil the entire bag (6 servings) and place what I do not use in individual plastic containers. I defrost as needed.<br /><br />TIP: do not freeze with sauce. If you do, upon defrosting the noodles will break up into tiny little pieces (each less then an inch long). If you freeze the pasta by itself, either defrost it in the fridge, or put in the microwave on the defrost setting. I finish it off by adding the noodles to the sauce in a frying pan. Stir gently and the noodle length will be mostly preserved.<br /><br />4) Easy to cook. The box says boil 8-9 minutes. I find it needs full 12 minutes. At that point it is still slightly al dente.<br /><br />TIP: I do not bother with adding butter/oil. I have never had this pasta stick. Just make sure the water is boiling before you add the pasta. And stir. When I store, even if it seems like the noodles are sticking, once you heat them up, they will come apart. Be gentle, do not force them.<br /><br />One last TIP: initially, I thought the single servings seemed smaller then they are with \"regular\" pasta.

Ahh, what I wouldn't give for a handful of half Illy and half New Mexico Pinon Roast, ground as fine as it will go, brewed strong, and sipped black.  Coffee drinkers will understand.<br /><br />I have since found any number of other things to drink, but still miss my coffee sometimes.  For a while, I tried decaf, but yuck.  I found a perfect decaf tea (PG Tips decaf is indistinguishable from the regular tea), and have come to enjoy a number of herbals and other brews, but have never a decent decaf coffee or coffee substitute.<br /><br />I found this stuff by accident online and bought a sample out of curiosity.  I liked that it was organic, and there's nothing in the ingredients that turned me off.  I really didn't expect it to be anything like coffee (they never are), but I thought it might be good in its own way.<br /><br />When the sample showed up, I ran a cup through my old drip-cone, and it was just ok.  A little watered down - I think I didn't use enough for the big mugful of water.  The funny thing though, was that it tasted like watered down coffee.  Just the way coffee used to taste when I didn't use enough for the amount of water.<br /><br />Second cup I used two big spoonfuls directly in the water and boiled it for 5 minutes.  After a minute or two, it started to smell like... well, coffee.  When poured, it had the same dark brown color and opaqueness I remember, and suddenly I was holding a cup of coffee.  I drank it black.  It was a passable cup - very satisfying - I actually stood there and gulped it down in the kitchen.<br /><br />It's smoother than I remember coffee being, less \"bite\" - probably because it doesn't have the same acids and oils that coffee does - but it does have a comparable taste and richness.  I never really liked flavored coffees, but the vanilla is very light - more a scent than a taste - and doesn't bother me at all.<br /><br />In fact, if you'd handed me a cup of this when I could still drink coffee, I might have looked at it sideways and asked where you found such a smooth roast, but I wouldn't have questioned that it WAS coffee.<br /><br />That's pretty impressive - kudos to whoever developed this stuff.

I cannot believe that it was not selling well. How much do you have to sell to call it a success?  Quaker had a product that was so much healthier than the sugared cereals that too many parents buy their kids, and they take away a very healthful cereal - one that a person will almost surely like immediately.  You could also add healthy fruits to it and make it an even better product for breakfast, for kids and adults.<br /><br />From someone who cannot eat cinnamon, just think of how many other cereals from Quaker have cinnamon in them!  I have a serious illness and this is one of the very few things I can eat. I need this cereal.  I hate buying a variety pack and thowing away most of it, but I have been doing that to get the 2 packets of Banana Bread cereal. I'll have to stop that however, since it is too expensive to continue buying it that way. EDITED on SEPTEMBER 16 2011- I have stopped buying the variety pack, or anything else Quaker if I can avoid it at all. I still have so much touble finding something I can eat that is healthy for me, that tastes good and that is easily digestible.<br /><br />Also, have you noticed that those two packets of Banana Bread Instant Oatmeal do not taste like the original?  They are not very good at all. Quaker changed the ingredients somehow, and either thought we could not tell the difference, or didn't care what we thought. But it is definitely different from the original, when it comes to taste. There is also less of it, since I used the same bowl for the original and for these wth the two packets, and I can tell by the amount it makes. What a ripoff they are pulling on the customer!<br /><br />I ask all of you who want this cereal to be returned to the grocery shelves, in its own box and not 2 in a variety pack, to call Quaker Oats and request this.

The only cat food he would eat consistently was Whiskas canned cat food. But alas, they discontinued that product line, switching to pouches and tubs (both of which he refuses to eat).  He will eat 9 Lives from time to time, but it gives him gas and appears to be high in fat (based on the pool of fat when can is dumped out in dish).  I have desperately tried numerous brands and flavors of cats foods for a number of years, but to no avail (Some brands and flavors I could get him to eat for a day or two, but then he refuses to eat it any longer).<br /><br />Then I came across Newman's Organic Chicken & Brown Rice at Dillon's Grocery (owned by Krogers) during a stay in Hutchinson, Kansas and he LOVES IT!  And, it appears to be fairly low in fat, which is a huge plus for an elderly cat with liver troubles (he currently has to be given Denosyl, which is also available on Amazon, to keep his liver in check).<br /><br />For those unaware, a cat with liver troubles is recommended to receive a low fat, low sodium diet, with no fish meal and no organ meat.  I've read online that vets recommend chicken and brown rice blended cat food. So, while I dont know exactly how much sodium, fat, and organ meat this product has (ingredients do list chicken liver, ocean whitefish, and sea salt), it appears to fit the bill (Ie: it doesnt have a pool of liquid fat when put in the dish) and so far my cat is doing well on this product (at long as I continue to medicate him with Denosyl, due to his liver disease - which helps protect the liver and keep the bile production down to a minimum).<br /><br />Unlike most other canned cat foods, he eats the entire can and begs for another!  Today he's eaten every bite of FIVE of the small 3oz sized cans!<br /><br />Ounce to ounce, it's a little more expensive than some canned cat foods, but well worth it in my opinion, especially since none of it is going to waste (whereas with other brands I have been going through 3-5 5oz cans of the other brands of cat food, twice a day - morning meal and evening meal - simply to find one that he will eat and then he only eats 1/2 to 2/3 of one of them for each meal, which makes for up to 9 wasted 5 oz cans a day!).

On the other hand, with a bubble gum such as Dubble Bubble, who cares?<br /><br />Dubble Bubble has a long and glorious history.  The gum traces its history back to a bubble gum called Blibber-Blubber developed by Frank Fleer in 1906.  That gum was never marketed.  Other people at Fleer's company continued to work on the bubble gum, with the formula finished by 1928.<br /><br />Perhaps the biggest change from the original Dubble Bubble to today's Dubble Bubble are the variations in flavor.  Double Bubble retains the original flavor along with a variety of other flavors, though the flavors are relatively mild.<br /><br />Dubble Bubble has two features that make it one of the superior bubble gums.  First, the gum gets softer as you chew it (more on that in a moment).  Second, the gum makes excellent bubbles.  I like the fact that the gum gets softer as you chew it, though it can be quite hard initially.  There are other brands that begin soft, but seem to get chewier and stiffer the longer you chew it.  I suppose the goal with those brands is to chew the flavor out and then toss the gum.  However, with Dubble Bubble you can chew the gum for a long time and the gum remains soft.<br /><br />I have made bubbles with Double Bubble gum a long time after I started chewing the gum.  Thus, the gum maintains its softness as well as its cohesiveness for making bubbles.  For even larger bubbles you can add a second gumball once the first one has been chewed for a while.  However, I recommend you abstain from a third gumball; the size of the gum becomes cumbersome at that point.<br /><br />In spite of the huge array of bubble gums on the market today, I continue to choose Dubble Bubble Gumballs as one of my favorites.  I suspect that I always will.<br /><br />Enjoy!", "dateOfBirth": "2002-06-21", "email": "Florent.Pasquier@yahoo.com"}, {"orcid": "0000-0002-4917-5552", "bio": "I love coffee!!

Its primary ingredients are whole grain rolled oats, almonds, cocoa and cinnamon.  Another is that it is not overly sweet.<br /><br />For me, the biggest downside to the granola is that, when I first opened the bag, many of the \"clusters\" were HUGE...the size of maybe 1/2 of a small candy bar.  If you're the type that eats granola as a snack right out of the bag, then that is probably going to be an advantage.  For me, it was a disadvantage.  I don't eat a lot of granola; but when I do, I use it as a light crunchy topping for yogurt or ice cream.  As such, I want it in smaller pieces.  I took a meat mallet to my bag and rectified the situation. :)<br /><br />The flavor of the granola is excellent.  In some bites, I get mostly a taste of cocoa and cinnamon and the crunch of the oats.  In others, I get more of the nut taste and texture.  As noted before, this granola is not overly sweet, which I like.  Despite the preponderance of cocoa in this granola, don't buy this expecting it to taste like a candy bar--this is cocoa, not chocolate.  Sweeteners listed include brown sugar, evaporated cane juice and honey.<br /><br />I thought it was misleading that the this variety is called \"Cinnamon Almond\" when the primary flavor is cocoa, but perhaps that is because all of their granolas are cocoa-based?  Not sure.  To me, it tastes much more of both cocoa and cinnamon than of almond.  I would never consider almond a primary flavor in it and I eat almonds pretty regularly, so I know their taste.<br /><br />If you like a good crunch, you're going to like this.

The bag arrives on time and in great condition.<br />  Let me preface this review by saying that I have never worked for or been associated in any way with the manufacturer or the distributor of this product. I am simply a discerning but thrifty dog owner.<br />  OK, down to brass tacks...ProPac High Performance Dog Food is worth every penny down to the last piece of kibble. My Golden is nine and a half years old and has been allergic her entire life to ALL the non-allergenic premium dog foods out there...with the exception of Propac, which is entirely made, from start to finish, in the US (and was never part of the melamine-laced dog food scandal several years ago that prematurely ended many dogs lives). Propac doesn't contain any of those dubious-quality ingredients you always find on pet food labels that are lumped under the catch-all term: by-products.<br />  With Propac, what you see on the label is what you get. No substitutions. Period. Chicken meal and fat, ground corn, flax seed, beet pulp, yeast culture and vitamin/mineral supplements. The ONLY preservative is vitamin E. Since my pooch isn't a 'working dog', she eats a fraction of whats recommended on the label. One cup twice a day maintains her svelte 75 lb figure. This dog food is a rare find nowadays: a reliable, quality product with the right price for my wallet.<br />  The best part? My dog(and every other canine fussy-eater I know who's wisely made the switch)goes absolutely WILD for this dog food. That NEVER happened with other premium brands...and these dogs have tried every one! The folks at Wells obviously know what they're doing, because this stuff stays fresh and palatable, from the first bowl to the last from every 33 lb bag.<br />  EVERYONE who touches my Golden is blown away by her incredibly soft, gleaming coat. Several weeks after my friends switched their four-legged family members to Propac, they discovered their dog's coats were likewise transformed from dull and dry to soft, luxurious and gleaming as well. No more flaky doggy-dandruff either! This is not my first dog and she surely won't be my last.

It seems as though I have tried most of the dandruff shampoos that exist.  Though it seems like some of them occasionally work, they do not seem to work all the time.  Consequently, I have used Head & Shoulders literally for decades.  When the opportunity came to try a new dandruff shampoo, I was all for it.<br /><br />The very first thing I noticed about this shampoo is that it seems very thick, much thicker than any shampoo I can recall using.  I tried trusty Head & Shoulders for comparison a couple of times.  My perception seems to be reality.  Clear Men Scalp Therapy shampoo is noticeably, pleasurably thicker than Head & Shoulders shampoo.<br /><br />The next thing I wondered about is the smell.  Head & Shoulders smells like - well - shampoo.  While the smell is relatively mild, it is nothing special.  In contrast, I think Clear Men Scalp Therapy has a pleasant fragrance.  I did have to hold the shampoo close to my nose to smell it because the smell is not overly strong and does not fill a room with its odor, which is a positive attribute in my mind.<br /><br />I could say something about how well the shampoo cleans, but it cleans like shampoo.  My hair felt soft and clean, which is how it should feel.  It also felt clean a second day after I used it.<br /><br />The magic question with respect to this shampoo is how well it does with respect to dandruff.  Well, it seems to work about the same as Head & Shoulders.  Since the dandruff-fighting ingredient in Clear Men Scalp Therapy is the same ingredient that is in Head & Shoulders, it should hardly be surprising that both shampoos work the same with respect to fighting dandruff.<br /><br />This shampoo also has a bunch of miscellaneous stuff that falls under the heading of nutrients and botanicals.  I am unable to tell much about the effectiveness of these various ingredients.  The ingredients sound impressive, but your hair is dead and I am unsure as to the effectiveness of fertilizing your skin.<br /><br />There remains one important aspect to this shampoo, and that is price.  After comparing the price of this shampoo to my standby, Head & Shoulders, I have concluded that this shampoo is relatively expensive.  I looked at several sizes of Head & Shoulders and without pulling out a calculator, it seems like this shampoo is about 50% more expensive than Head & Shoulders, give or take 10 or 20%.  I love the thickness of the shampoo and the smell, but I am unable to justify the price.  I know more expensive shampoos exist, but think about it, shampoo is essentially soap for your hair.  I struggle to think one soap that costs approximately 50% more than another soap is really worth 50% more unless the more expensive shampoo does something magical.  I am missing the magic here.<br /><br />Shampoo serves a useful and important function.  Dandruff shampoo serves two important functions, cleaning your hair and reducing or eliminating the dry skin that is dandruff.  This shampoo does the first quite well and the second about as well as Head & Shoulders.  The only question I have is whether a shampoo significantly more expensive than another shampoo is value added in my life, or any other person's life.<br /><br />Enjoy!", "dateOfBirth": "1979-03-07", "email": "Giuseppe.Mazzuoccolo@hotmail.com"}, {"orcid": "0000-0002-7499-5798", "bio": "I don't know exactly how we ended up with a 160-bag box of tea <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000XEV9YE\">Taylors of Harrogate, Yorkshire Gold Tea, 160-Count Tea Bags</a>, but I think my first reaction was \"well THAT will last us approximately forever.\" HOWEVER, it instantly became, by far and away, the favorite tea in our household.

I compared the box to my old one and found the same SKU number but the roast level has been dropped from medium to very light along with the color change.  My taste test revealed exactly that... a mild, relatively tasteless coffee more like their dishwater Daybreak than the old Caribou blend.  Caribou (I got this second hand) claims that their flagship blend is more of a light roast than a medium roast and they made the change accordingly. Yeah, sure. Nice try but we all know that the wholesale price of coffee has skyrocketed.  Sounds to me, the skeptic, that perhaps they have been forced to switch to a cheaper coffee with less gusto and more bitterness to maintain their competitive price points.  How sad.  I would have gladly paid more for my favorite.  The new blend is far inferior.  If you're a regular, have someone  brew both and I bet you'll have no problem distinguishing the difference.

I have vivid memories of laying awake into the late hours of the night before exhaustion and sleep would settle in.  When I reached high school, the stress transformed the frequent headaches into occasional migraines.  I treated them for a while with prescription medicine but eventually decided I'd rather live with the pains and adjust in the necessary ways than continue taking medication.  About a year ago, I read an article about Natural CALM and figured `What the heck.'  I was highly doubtful.  I've never been so glad to be wrong.<br /><br />I buy the raspberry-lemon flavor.  To me, it tastes like a bit of raspberry lemonade Crystal Light mixed with an Alka-Seltzer.  I certainly wouldn't drink it just because I'm thirsty, but I can tolerate a 12 oz. glass of it in the evening.  In the beginning, I didn't feel much of a difference.  However, once I started taking about 1 teaspoon - which you have to work up to - I noticed a difference in my quality of sleep.  I kept slowly raising the amount and now use about 2 teaspoons nightly.  I don't find that the CALM makes me fall asleep earlier/faster, but I have found that I don't constantly wake up like I did before.  The nighttime leg cramps have almost completely gone.  And the headaches - the constant pounding and throbbing and aching in my head has diminished to just the occasional headache.  As an added benefit, I seem to deal with stress (especially work stress) much better than I did before.  I tried something else to help with sleep (see below) and, after I stopped taking that, I didn't start taking the CALM again for a little while to see if I could actually tell a difference in the way I felt, slept, and reacted to events.  I did - and so did some others around me!  From now on, I don't plan to go without it.<br /><br />I love this stuff and I turn as many people onto it as I can.  A friend purchased some CALM (the regular flavor:  it worked but tasted pretty bad and made the nightly dose challenging to keep up with) and decided to try <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000N23AE8\">SERIPHOS - 100 - Capsule</a> when she ran out of CALM.  While I was visiting, she gave me some to try.  We both found that it gave us the oddest nightmares and made us very groggy/tired in the morning.  My mother, at her doctor's recommendation, started taking a small dose of melatonin to help her get to sleep and stay asleep through the entire night (she'd often get up about 3 AM and couldn't get back to sleep).  Several times after she started taking it, I called her and she slurred her words as if she were taking some sort of narcotic and she wouldn't remember that she'd even spoken to me on the phone.  I sent her a bottle of the orange flavor (she said it tastes ok - like a Sunny D Alka-Seltzer) and she actually adds it to her morning and bedtime cups of decaf orange tea instead of using the melatonin.  She's sleeping like a champ now.<br /><br />If you're considering the purchase, do it!

Our two cats have been living on various \"high end\" dry cat foods for some time now (e.g., the \"Before Grain\" foods in chicken, tuna and salmon versions, and some fancy pantsy \"Duck a l'orange\" stuff from our local pet shop).  They have not been partial to canned foods, nor have I often gone the canned food route because it is less than convenient and didn't seem worth the candle since they seem to favor dry food (and mice and birds and whatever else they can glean from our little acre in the woods).  They typically start out loving canned food, but after a few bites, the rest sits in the bowl and dries out before we toss it and go back to the dry food they've grown to love.<br /><br />However, both of our cats are smitten by this stuff.  It looks like real food out of the can, with large chunks of fish and seafood in a thickened broth.  It doesn't have the strong fishy smell of most canned foods and looks like something I could almost be tempted to eat my self in a pinch.  The 3 ounce size makes it perfect for a \"treat\" for the cats between feedings of dry food and they leave nothing behind when we dump a can in their dish (with some added hot water as they really love the broth).<br /><br />But I'm not sure I want my cats eating this stuff for the same reason I don't want my eight year old eating at fast food franchises, much as she might love the food and snarf it up in a flash -- I'm concerned this food may not be a healthy thing for the animal eating it or for the planet. Seeing \"Made in Thailand\" emblazoned on the box made me immediately wonder whether this stuff might include ingredients banned in the US or could otherwise be manufactured without adequate regulation of methods and materials.  The Chinese pet food fiasco certainly came to mind.<br /><br />The discussions of other reviewers about the menadione used in this product confirms my concern.  I'm also left to wonder about the source of the fish and seafood in these cans -- is it farm raised in Thailand and if so under what conditions; is it wild fish that may be subject to overfishing and at the very least ought to be feeding hungry humanity rather than going down my cats' gullets; what about mercury and other contaminants in the food?<br /><br />Bottom line: my cats seem to love the stuff, but I'm not sure that will be sufficient to convince me to buy it again.", "dateOfBirth": "1966-09-21", "email": "Haiseyin.Hakli@gmail.com"}, {"orcid": "0000-0001-7344-5826", "bio": "And this little gadget does the job much better than a Melitta style funnel and paper filter.

In fact, I don't like most candy because it is too sweet for me.<br /><br />To my surprise, the nutrition information for this product claims zero sodium. Apparently, ammonium chloride is not metabolized as sodium in the human body. So the \"salt\" label is a bit of a misnomer. Yes, technically ammonia chloride is a salt, but not table salt and not sodium. I guess I will find out in a couple of hours how this stuff agrees with my digestive system. But if I'm allergic to it, that's my bad, not the fault of the product. Prior to K & H's Double Salt Licorice, I tried the Diamond (Zout) salt licorice by Gerrit Verbourg, which was also yummy, so I know already I am not very allergic.<br /><br />I like the taste, but it's not mind-blowing. I don't feel overpowered by the saltiness at all. I can pop three in my mouth at a time and chew with no problem. However, I have learned not to chew. I recommend sucking on the tokens instead until they slowly dissolve. This way a more intense licorice flavor is achieved, and less candy sticks to one's molars.<br /><br />One cautionary note, this coming from my Mother, that I would like to add for all licorice aficionados like myself. Consume licorice in MODERATION. Why? No, not because of tooth decay, although that's a good reason too, this candy being gooey and sticking to teeth. Not because of the calories, although calories is a valid concern. Not even because of the ammonia chloride, although that may have certain negative effects on human digestion in large quantities... Really the chief concern is that the licorice itself, and licorice extract, interferes with the human body's absorption of potassium and also has many other complicated interactions with the body. If you like licorice, a good idea would be to add bananas to your diet as well, because bananas are cheap, delicious and rich in potassium. But do not eat large quantities every day. If you find yourself bruising easily and taking a long time to recover from bruises, your licorice habit could be the cause. Word to the wise. Everything in moderation, dontcha know?<br /><br />Five stars because the product was just what it said it was, was manufactured 02-2012 and doesn't expire until 2014. All in all, an excellent value considering the price, and Amazon had it on my front porch less than two days after I ordered it. Maybe there is better salt licorice for sale somewhere on the Internet, I don't know, but I know for sure there isn't cheaper licorice. Note to other reviewers: no fair dissing the product because you don't like ammonia chloride.

And the cup is smooth and almost velvety, pretty much all you could hope for from this sort of blend.<br /><br />I'm not saying they've won me over to the flavored coffee camp, but I will say that this is a cup of coffee I can respect in spite of the addition of a flavor.

The refrigerated stuff from the grocery store goes bad right away and does not taste as good as the fresh stuff from the garden, either.<br /><br />Then I saw a Time Magazine page on the new AeroGrow AeroGarden, and I just had to try it out. After reading the AeroGrow website before making the purchase, I realized that buying one garden would not work for me, as the tomatoes cannot be grown in the same garden as lettuce & herbs. This is partially due to the large amount of room taken up by the tomatoes, and also because the lamp/watering cycle is different and finally because the nutrients are different.<br /><br />So, I bought two gardens, along with the Salad Greens seed kit and Cherry Tomato seed kit. Each garden comes with a mixed herb kit, so I figured to mix in a few herbs with the other seeds, and if they did not work, no big loss.<br /><br />The products came quickly and the instructions for assembly were very clear and well written with excellent diagrams. I came to realize that this somewhat pricey product at least comes from a company that produces a classy product (a rare thing these days). I found a space on a shelf beside the basement stairs, and placed both assembled gardens there. I also bought and placed a digital thermometer with maximum/minimum temperature memory readouts ($10 at Radio Shack), because I was unsure of what temperature extremes the plants might experience in that location (68-72 as it turns out).<br /><br />The seed kits contain pre-seeded planting pods. Each pod is basically a plastic cup shaped frame with two pieces of foam rubber inside the cup part, like two slices of bread with the seeds sandwiched between them. They simply insert into the seven holes in the top of the garden's water tank. The Salad Greens and Herbs come with seven pods per kit, while the Tomatos come with three pods plus four hole plugs-the plants are bigger so three of them take up thw whole space available. The hole plugs prevent evaporation of the water through the unoccupied holes.<br /><br />The water tank holds exactly one gallon of regular drinking water. Well water is not recommended, presumably because of impurities, and since I am on a well I bought two one-gallon plastic jugs of 'drinking water' at the store for 50 cents each and filled the tanks with their contents. A pump in the tank takes water and pipes it to the rim of each of the seven holes in the tank's top, and here the trickle of water flows into the foam sandwich of each seed pod. The foam stays moist and the rest of the water drips back down into the tank. The garden's 'computer' cycles the water flow on and off according to the amount recommended for the type of plant being grown. A water level sensor turns on a flashing red light when it is time to add more water to the tank.<br /><br />The top of the garden is a reflector with two compact-fluorescent lamps, of the variety that has the special ultraviolet (UV) coating that causes the emmitted light to resemble sunlight. The reflector rides on a vertical pole that extends up from the garden's base, so you can raise and lower the lamps as required to keep them the correct distance above the plants. The garden's 'computer' also turns the lamps on and off according to a schedule tailored to the type of plant. If using the gardens in a place where the light might be a problem at night, you can syncronize the computer so that the lights are on only during the daytime and off when you are trying to sleep.<br /><br />The seed kits come with little clear plastic cups that cover each pod until the seeds have germinated, then you can dispose of them. The kits also come with a bag of nutrient tablets, which you add to the water tank when the computer prompts you to by flashing a red light. The nutrients are tailored to the type of plant being grown, and there are enough of them to feed the plants during their anticipated life span.<br /><br />I planted one garden with five salad green (leaf lettuce) pods, plus one pod each from the Herb kit, chives and parsley. The other garden got the threee pods from the Cherry Tomato kit; two reds and one yellow variety.<br /><br />Each seed pod has a label that tells you how many days to wait for plants to appear after germination. All of my plants appeared like clockwork.<br /><br />I have had the gardens for about six weeks now, and have been enjoying salads containing lettuce, parsley and chives plus other odds and ends from the fridge, for the last two or three weeks. The lettuce and herbs are all beautiful, with no problems from bugs or too much/too little water, excessive temperatures, etc. No need to wash the plants or check for bugs or pick off bad spots, everything goes straight to the salad bowl. What a joy! Even with only five lettuce plants, I have to eat two meals including salad each day to keep up with the growth. This would easily feed two people, and if all seven salad green pods had been used, three people.<br /><br />The tomatoes are all doing well ahnd have been pruned according to instructions. It will be some time yet before they produce flowers, and then fruit. But based on the health of the plants, I expect a good yield.<br /><br />Each seed kit comes with a full color manual/booklet that covers all aspects of 'planting', germinating, feeding, pruning (if required) and then harvesting the plants. There are also photos of plants where things have gone wrong (leaves burned because the lamps were not raised up as the plants grew taller, etc) with clear instructions on how to recognize problems and correct them. Harvesting instructions clearly tell how much can be taken at a time without killing the plant, and so on.<br /><br />The AeroGrow gardens are a well designed, well built product with excellent documentation. All my visitors are amazed at how well the product works, and many have gone out and bought their own. I anticipate years of improved eating because of this product.<br /><br />*****************<br /><br />Update November 2007<br /><br />I used my two gardens all Winter (2006/2007) until it was time to start getting produce from my real (outdoor) garden in the Summer, at which time I put the little gardens to rest for the season. During their use, I got a large crop of cherry tomatoes, all of which were beautiful. I went through on crop of lettuce and salad greens, and when the lettuce finally bolted, I replanted with only lettuce (no chives, etc this time) and got another couple of months worth of lettuce. I have now fired them up again in the Fall, and have nice little plants popping up. Aerogrow has more seed options available now, so I have planted a more interesting kind of lettuce.", "dateOfBirth": "1971-02-04", "email": "Ilya.Dumer@hotmail.com"}, {"orcid": "0000-0002-2149-1916", "bio": "I love these.

We were given a bag of Science Diet when we brought her home from the shelter and she wouldn't eat that.  My daughter picked up a bag of Iam's puppy food and that's what we were giving her the first month. Her poops smelled so bad from day one when we got her and didn't improve on the Iam's.  She seemed to have consistently runny poops as well.  She was also constantly itchy and scratching at herself.  We switched to Wellness puppy food and after the initial introduction for her to get used to that brand we haven't looked back.  She loves it!  She is now on the adult formula even though she's not quite a year old (read that beagles should be switched over to adult food at about 6 months because they have reached their full height).<br /><br />We are finishing up her second bag on the adult formula and she is looking beautiful, sleek and healthy.  We have so many people comment about how pretty she is and, especially, how soft her fur is. Her poops rarely smell and when they do it is usually because she was given new treats/snacks or one she hasn't had in awhile.<br /><br />I have seen some reviews (mostly from the puppy formula) with people complaining about runny stools but it is important to gradually get your dog used to any new dog food and gradually build up the amount by mixing it with the dog food you are replacing.  We even did this when we switched from the puppy to adult formula even though it probably wasn't as necessary to do that as both were the lamb formulas.<br /><br />She's full of energy and very happy and seems to love her dog food as she always eats it up and sometimes will carry in her bowl looking for seconds!!<br /><br />Also love how fast this company ships out the dog food too!

I even used to make my own when I was younger. I've tried a variety of brands before but this is the first time trying out Wild Ride. It claims to be Hormone and Nitrate free with no added MSG, and while the ingredients listed do confirm their claims this beef jerky has got to be some of the driest, tasteless I have ever eaten.<br /><br />Kickin' Teriyaki is the flavor I got. To be sure I didn't just get a bad package I opened two bags and both sets of jerky was dry and tasteless. I do not taste anything \"kickin\" about this jerky and there is virtually no Teriyaki flavor either. To make things worse the dry jerky tends to have a powdery taste to it because it is made with Soy Sauce POWDER instead of Soy Sauce (this is to get around saying it has no added MSG). Instead of imparting a nice Teriyaki flavor you get this powedery taste to the jerky and mixed with the bit of onion and corn starch in the jerky, it almost is like they coated it with onion powder instead of Teriyaki.<br /><br />On the plus side however, this is a nitrate free product which is a good thing as many other jerkies tend to have Sodium Nitrate in them. Also with both packages I have opened currently, the jerky breaks down easily and isn't tough as leather nor does it contain any sinew it seems.<br /><br />OVERALL this jerky just seems extremely tasteless and powdery. While it doesn't contain \"added\" MSG, Nitrates or hormones, they got around this by using powdered versions of ingredients (powdered vinegar and soy sauce) plus it contains Dextrose and Fructose , modified food starch and corn starch and SUGAR is your second ingredient. I've never seen so much sugar and starch added to jerky in my life. So despite being hormone and nitrate free, this jerky (in my opinion) is barely palatable and should be avoided", "dateOfBirth": "1963-03-13", "email": "Jaana.Hallamaa@yahoo.com"}, {"orcid": "0000-0001-7863-7018", "bio": "I just received the order today and all 4 of the Capri Sun boxes were very soaked to the point that the cardboard boxes are falling apart.

My family had so much fun with Charlie-Amanda that we soon adopted another pooch, Pippin.  If you're wondering why I'm telling you all this, it's so that you have the background on where I'm coming from with respects to this review.  Essentially we love our pups and I spent a lot of time last year reading up on dog foods.<br /><br />PACKAGING:<br />The 15.5 pound bag of Beneful dog food comes nicely packaged.  It was delivered in a box that was appropriately sized.  The Beneful bag itself is super sturdy, plasticized, and has what looks to be a sturdy 'ziplock' opener at the top.  This is just the sort of thing you need with a large amount of kibble to keep it fresh and appealing to dogs.  So bonus points here (although the superior option would be biodegradable).<br /><br />THE KIBBLE:<br />The kibble is attractive and smells okay.  There are different sizes, shapes, textures, and colors.<br /><br />MY DOGS REACTION:<br />As I mentioned, I've got two pups.  One's a year old JRT-mix and the other's a 8 month-old Moyen-sized poodle.  They both thought that the food smelled interesting, but they didn't chow it down.  They would eat quite a bit if I hand fed them the kibble, but they'd only eat out of the bowl if they were very hungry.  In fairness I should note that they are the pickiest eaters in the universe, and sometimes they'll even turn their noses up at human chicken and hot dogs.  I expect most dogs would eat this food.  Certainly our neighbor's dog, who is always breaking into the house to scour it clean, gulped down every little tidbit.<br /><br />NUTRITION:<br />--Much research has led me to understand that it can be difficult to calculate the actual price of a dog food.  \"Cheap\" dog foods, for example, may not be as cheap as they seem because dogs need to eat more of lower quality food than higher quality.  If you look at this example you'll see what I mean.  The Beneful package suggests that a dog of 15 pounds should eat around 1.25-to-1.7 cups of food per day.  A similarly sized dog need only eat 1 cup of Eukanuba small breed kibble.  Now Eukanuba appears to be more expensive per bag, but is it?<br /><br />My point is that those of us who are frugal need to crunch the numbers before they purchase.<br /><br />--Beneful is a low quality food source for dogs.  Dogs are omnivores but they really need protein and the first ingredients for Beneful are ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, corn gluten meal, whole wheat flour.  Compare their 25% protein product with what I'm currently feeding my dogs which has 32% protein, and whose ingredients are Chicken, Chicken By-products and Corn meal.  And there are other products out there with even higher protein levels.<br /><br />--Keep in mind that some dogs are allergic to corn and food dyes.  If your pup is one of these, skip Beneful.<br /><br />CONTROVERSY:<br />--There's a number of controversies surround Beneful and it's manufacturer, Nestl&eacute; Purina.  The parent company, Nestl&eacute;, has been involved in a number of recalls for both human and pet foods.  They use ingredients from China for the dog food, and there are many complaints against them in 2012 for dog treats.<br /><br />--The Dog Food Advisor website gives Beneful 1-Star for high fat and carbohydrate levels.<br /><br />CONCLUSIONS<br />Beneful is an okay product.  It's the type of dog food that my grandmother would have purchased in bulk to feed the strays she was always taking in.  It is VERY convenient to have it delivered, and the packaging is excellent, and for some people who have a difficult time getting out of the house, this is going to be a great option.<br /><br />Currently Beneful appears to be safe to use.  Nestl&eacute;'s reputation is not sterling however and dog owners should keep an eye to the news for recalls and reports of poisons since Purina uses foodstuffs from China.<br /><br />Pam T~<br />mom and fur-mom", "dateOfBirth": "1991-11-20", "email": "Jai.Pandey@hotmail.com"}, {"orcid": "0000-0002-5476-7130", "bio": "Our GreatDane loves these , he's never happy with just one !! we have been feeding him these for about a year now & they smell really great !!", "dateOfBirth": "2003-03-05", "email": "Jaime.Gala\u00a1n-Jimacnez@gmail.com"}, {"orcid": "0000-0002-3635-7592", "bio": "I got a sample of these treats in an box of litter which I had ordered on the internet, and offered them to Corey the Cat.

Also unfortunately, while the box says it holds \"single serve pods\" it does not specify that they're pods for a machine, or in fact what machines they work with.  The packets themselves say nothing at all about pods or machines.<br /><br />So here's the problem: I have a box of single serve coffee pods which don't really tell me much of anything, requested because I thought they were simply single-serve coffee bags, not unlike tea bags.  And I don't own a pod coffee maker.  I don't like them very much.  I'm going to have to improvise in order to do any sort of review.<br /><br />I tossed a couple of pods into my standard drip coffee maker and added two cups of water (The classic 6 oz cup by which coffee is still measured in spite of the fact that we now live in a world where 16 oz cups are considered small.) What I got back out was a brew that would make church coffee laugh derisively. So then I just threw two bags into a cup and added 12 oz of hot water, and let them steep until the brew looked darker, and that actually worked pretty well.  With due respect to the gentleman who said \"teabagging\" with these things doesn't work, I have to disagree.  It makes a decent enough cup.  The coffee isn't strong, but it is smooth, and has has the classic African warmth and brightness.<br /><br />In all fairness, the truest test of this coffee would be to use it in a pod-style coffee maker, but absent that, you can actually make a decent cup without much work.  Just remember that it's 1 pod to each 6 oz of water, no matter what the instructions say.<br /><br />Which brings me to a gripe.  Where the heck are people finding instructions?  There are none on the box, none on the individual packets.  The only instruction I found was on the pod itself.  One side says: \"This side down\"  Seriously, even if your product is for a machine, it's a good idea to be clear about how to use the product in that machine.<br /><br />All in all, Marley Coffee got points for flavor but lost them for unnecessarily vague packaging and the fact that it's kind of pricey.  I don't honestly think that I'd change my review substantially even if I had a pod-style coffee maker to test it with, however if I do manage to find one and it changes my opinion, I will absolutely update this review.<br /><br />Amazon, you need to give a bit more information in your descriptions for Vine reviewers.

This is my second product with them and will most likely be my last as the other one had some design flaws as well. Overall, the concepts seem to be good, but there's always one glaring flaw and cheap materials/construction. This treat wheel is a good idea: pull out the \"pegs\" and find the treat then use your nose to push the wheel around until you find a secondary treat in another chamber. However, the execution is anything but good. First, the pegs are in too deep and with little (except a dangerously small hole to snag a nail) to grip except super slippery plastic. I tried myself to push and pull the item out of place, and it wouldn't budge (not surprising since 3/4 of it is \"buried\") and my dogs just grew frustrated and quit. I thought of using it without the pegs and just as a spinner but all the chambers are connected, and the top portion is so badly attached to the bottom that it wobbles about instead of spinning smoothly around. Plus, the chambers are so slick (all the toy being made of that same super slippery plastic) that the treat just slides around. And forget durability. I've seen Dollar Store toys constructed better.

If you want them to last longer -- freeze them in the unopened containers for up to 4 months.

Being scientifically accurate, I brought four dogs to the (figurative) table:  two Rat Terriers (Riley and Hawk), a Doberman (Halle), and a Brown Lab (Polo).<br /><br />For testing purposes, I (really, I did!) set out four bowls.  My idea was to let each of them take a choice of the four:  Beneful by Purina, Chef Michael's (this product), Kirkland Lamb & Rice (their regular food), and strangely enough, dry cat food which seems to be a hit with all of them (they obsess over it).<br /><br />Each dog had a turn.  I'm not sure if it was the look of it, because it looks like a real pot roast dinner, but this product got woofed down the fastest.  They didn't even look at the others.  I don't think dogs see in color, so am convinced it wasn't the colorful kibbles.  My testing problem was that trying to take each dog away and put them aside to let the other dogs have a turn at the taste test was fraught with danger. They did NOT want to give it up.  The Kirkland and the Beneful didn't warrant any interest, even when Chef Michael's was gone and those were the only options.  Even the cat food that they usually go for (probably just to get on the cat's nerves) sat unnibbled.<br /><br />So, easy to say, this was a hit.  Small dog and big, none had trouble with the size of the food.  It sort of looks like Chunky Stew without the liquid.  Also, a side bonus was that the gassy little rat terriers didn't seem so gassy after....although, this bag only allowed them four dinners between the four dogs.  Now that it's gone, they are sad.<br /><br />If I could afford this regularly, I would purchase it.  There was no waste, nothing for the blue jays to hit on the next day.

Now some of you are gonna say that's because it's not what he is used to.

Before his stomach would get really tight but then it would just gush out, oh the joys of parenthood.  After talking to the doctor there apparently is nothing to concern ourselves about.

We end up having to buy 1 can locally towards the end of the month which at 86 dollars a shipment basically means the money we saved just goes towards 1 can.

I'm a vegetarian, so like anyone with a restricted diet, I found myself getting into a rut with my meals. I gave this a try, because I was looking to add some variety to my meals. It is wonderful.<br /><br />MY FAVORITE MEAL<br />First, I fix the rice. That only takes about 25 minutes and is nothing more complicated than boiling water. Then, in a separate pan I cook some kind of vegetarian sausage (I used to use boca sausage, but that seems to have been discontinued). I usually season it with pepper, a bit of soy sauce, and garlic. I prefer to wait for them to get crispy on the verge of burnt. That seems to help them keep their flavor. After that, I put some green peppers, onions, and spinach in with the sausage. Finally, I put it all into the pot with the rice. I cook the vegetables/sausage separately from the rice because I want them to retain their flavor. It gives the jambalaya a more complicated taste.<br /><br />Make space for this in your pantry. One box serves six (not counting whatever meat/vegetables you add), so for an individual you'll have 72 meals with this! If you only fix this meal once or twice a week, you are looking at about a year's worth of jambalaya.

I investigated as to why and found that it has 20% chloride which is a good thing if you don't have high acid in your stomach already.  But Google this and you'll see that adding extra chloride will aggravate any acid issues you may already have. I was so surprised because I expected any coconut water to be so alkaline that any acid issues just wouldn't come into play.

I tasted these chips expecting a basic tortilla chip with a hint of flavor, which is what I am used to tasting. The flavor was stronger than subtle and the chips were utlra-fresh tasting. Straight up, here's the pros and cons:<br />PROS: Super fresh. Nice portion size, especially because you'll want more than one portion. Attractive on a plate, unlike traditional tortilla chips. Good amount of flavoring. Light, not greasy. Chips were sturdy and didn't crumble in the bag easily. No pile of \"chip-lets\" at the bottom. Would probably be a nice surprise in someone's lunch box or at a movie party or summer get-together.<br /><br />CONS: Probably not great for dipping. If you're an olive lover, you may prefer the flavor to be more potent, as I did. If you're concerned about packaging waste, there's a lot of extra bag here which seems wasteful.<br /><br />I personally felt the olive flavor could have been stronger, so I withheld one star, but that is my personal taste.

I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it \"healthy,\" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this.

They loved the taste but I couldn't stand the smell.  The preservative used is a bisulfite (I incorrectly state bisulfate in my review) and it breaks down to sulfur dioxide (one of the smells of burning matches) on standing.  I don't know if they use too much preservative but either way I never liked the thought of so much of it being there.  Although the Canyon Creek came from China I figured how could they screw up yams?  Anyway, I saw these in the store and saw the Made in the USA label and decided to give them a try.  For me they are better in every way, cheaper, no smell, last longer on chewing, better texture, bigger sizes.<br /><br />Some other notes that I forgot to include in the video, they are labeled as vegetable rawhides, they don't last anywhere near as long as a real rawhide.  Maybe a minute for my big dog.  Also some reviewers noted that their dogs either didn't like them or got sick after eating them.  My dogs experience no loose stools or vomiting and they will beg for these treats readily when I go for the bag (obvious in the video when I pull the treat from the bag and he immediately comes up to grab it), but again this depends on the dog.  These treats fit very well with my wish to feed my dogs a quality product whenever price will allow.<br /><br />Edit:  The price on these seems to fluctuate heavily.  When I bought these and wrote the review they were $9.99, that was a good deal for what they are and comparable with the other brands, but at $18.99 a bag I wouldn't really consider them worth it any more and I would buy other treats instead.", "dateOfBirth": "1962-12-21", "email": "Kirsten.Butcher@gmail.com"}, {"orcid": "0000-0001-8461-4023", "bio": "Love this product!

The one thing that stays consistent is that the coffee becomes drinkable (hot, but not scalding) within a couple of minutes.  I use cream in my coffee, so in a coffee cup I will usually use 2 joulies and with my travel mug I use 3 joulies.  The general rule I have come up with is it increases drinking time to about 2 or 2 1/2 times the original time.  For example, in my open, no cover coffee cup, my coffee stays hot about 20-30 minutes and in my poorly insulated travel mug with cover, my coffee stays hot about an hour and a half rather than 30-45 minutes.  I just recently bought an insulated mug and am very excited to use the joulies with it, because I know I am going to have perfect temperature coffee for hours (much longer than my coffee usually lasts).<br /><br />This is a product I would recommend to any coffee drinker, as long as they know the type of cup you use does make a difference in the results you are going to get!

I usually stick with the cheddar cheese flavor because they are my favorite, but my local store was having a sale to benefit the USO, so I bought 10 bags of different flavors. This was one of the new ones I am trying out. I have to say that my first rice cake was extremely like a sour cream and onion flavored potato chip, which I don't mind at all because I like that flavor- I was just not expecting it! There is definitely a onion-y powder used in this. I found it to be nice and subtle throughout the serving. I like to keep myself at 10 rice cakes per serving, and the first rice cake was heavily flavored, while the rest imparted a more pepper and salt type of flavor, with the onion as a side note. I suspect the reason for the first cake seeming so powerful is because it was the first to hit my palate, and not because of over powdering.

My body burns them up too quickly, and then find myself in that droopy 'low blood sugary' feeling.

Every bite is super crunchy.<br /><br />I have tried it in milk, but didn't really like it that way. Instead, I use a fruit variety of kefir, which is sort of like a creamy yogurt drink. I've tried Ezekiel with peach, pomegranite and mixed berry kefir varieties, and it is a tasty combination. If you want to try this, keep in mind that kefir is a bit thicker than milk. I prefer just enough kefir to moisten the cereal so that the grains remain the star of the show.<br /><br />Ezekiel is a very healthy cereal, perhaps the healthiest one available. It isn't going to taste like kids cereal because kids cereal isn't super-healthy. Straight-out-of-the-box Ezekiel with milk probably is hard core cold turkey if you're reforming from bad eating habits (like I am!).

For the record, I love the slightly-sour taste of Dunkin Donuts coffee and I find the stuff made by \"that other chain\" to be akin to re-hydrated cigarette ash.  For many years, we still percolated coffee...with most big-name brands of pre-ground coffee, you needed a percolator to bring out the flavor in it, but again, your tastes may vary.<br /><br />With my Keurig, my favorite coffee was Paul Neumans Extra Bold....because it didn't seem Extra Bold.  Until you buy 80 of them and get tired of the flavor.  Then, my favorites were the Caribu's....but something happened to that brand (see reviews) and I agree, they did something...either they don't put as much in the cups or they changed the blend, the sourcing of the beans, etc......wasted money on Caribu and wont go back to the brand.<br /><br />So Wolfgang Puck got the nod, tried 4 different flavors.  This one, Sorrento, is not my favorite of the bunch (currently Colombian Chef's Reserve).  It has a bolder strength (which I believe hard core coffee drinkers would consider Medium), but to me it has a simple burnt flavor to it.

Another is that it is not overly sweet.<br /><br />For me, the biggest downside to the granola is that, when I first opened the bag, many of the \"clusters\" were HUGE...the size of maybe 1/2 of a small candy bar.  If you're the type that eats granola as a snack right out of the bag, then that is probably going to be an advantage.  For me, it was a disadvantage.

I took a meat mallet to my bag and rectified the situation. :)<br /><br />The flavor of the granola is excellent.  In some bites, I get mostly a taste of cocoa and cinnamon and the crunch of the oats.  In others, I get more of the nut taste and texture.  As noted before, this granola is not overly sweet, which I like.  Despite the preponderance of cocoa in this granola, don't buy this expecting it to taste like a candy bar--this is cocoa, not chocolate.  Sweeteners listed include brown sugar, evaporated cane juice and honey.<br /><br />I thought it was misleading that the this variety is called \"Cinnamon Almond\" when the primary flavor is cocoa, but perhaps that is because all of their granolas are cocoa-based?  Not sure.  To me, it tastes much more of both cocoa and cinnamon than of almond.  I would never consider almond a primary flavor in it and I eat almonds pretty regularly, so I know their taste.<br /><br />If you like a good crunch, you're going to like this.

The flavor is very floral with no bitterness at all unless you overbrew it.<br />The tea is fascinating to watch when it brews.  The 'pearls' will unroll into little branches, which are the tender shoots of the tea plant.  Because the tea shoots are large, there is no need for an infuser since they stay at the bottom of the cup.  In fact, the metal of the infuser can give the delicatley flavored tea a funny metallic taste.  So I don't reccommend using a metal infuser, if you are squeamish about seeing your tea leaves at the bottom of the cup, go for a nice ceramic infuser.  They make teacups with a built in ceramic strainer, one of those would be ideal for this tea.<br />One caution: it is done when it TASTES done, even if it doesn't LOOK done.

This becomes especially noticeable for frequent drinkers of Diet Coke or Diet Pepsi.  Yet that isn't the main problem with the SodaStream offering.  The truth is simply that consumers are paying way too much for C02 refills -- sixteen times (16x) too much.<br /><br />While the general idea of at-home carbonation is solid, consumers should understand that they are grossly overpaying for SodaStream carbon dioxide refills. In fact, the prices charged are sixteen times (16x) wholesale costs or many, many times more expensive than the prices a restaurant would pay. In Europe, frugal consumers are aware of such markups and actually purchase their own restaurant-sized CO2 refills. In the US, we aren't so frugal.<br /><br />Other than the outrageous costs for the CO2 refills, there are other issues with the SodaStream Fountain Jet. One is the construction quality is quite low with very thin molded plastic and little weight. Additionally, the taste of generic soda flavors do not match that of the brand name products.<br /><br />Below is the calculated cost per two liter for the output of SodaStream soda. This includes the cost of the consumables AND the equipment costs. I have used very generous assumptions, including a low discount rate (i.e. cost of money).<br /><br />Transportation costs were not factored because 1) purchases of typical groceries should more or less overlap with soft drink purchases 2) grocery delivery has long been available in many areas 3) most people live closer to a grocery store than to a home furnishings store (I walk 100 ft. for groceries and drive one mile for BB&B) 4) the reverse logistics for the CO2 refills is an extra expense for the retailer that has to be factored into its profit margin and will ultimately be borne by the consumer.<br /><br />One of the reasons Bed Bath & Beyond, Macy's and Crate and Barrel choose to carry SodaStream is that they want the consumer to make MORE FREQUENT trips to their establishments for consumables. Instead of going to such establishments once every 3 to 6 months, customers will now visit once every 1 to 2 months. That makes an enormous difference for generating impulse purchases at such retailers.

My fault for not reading thoroughly.

I really couldn't detect the berry in the coffee by smell but the floral was definitely there and both were present in taste with a slight chocolate taste. I think this coffee is very similar to <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004779XNW\">Green Mountain Coffee, Dark Magic (Extra Bold), 24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers</a>, just not as bold in flavor and more of a medium flavored coffee.

I brewed a second cup in the Keurig, adding a teaspoon of chocolate coffee creamer, which brought out the chocolate flavor that's traditionally found in Ethiopian Yirgacheffe coffee, along with the Splenda made the coffee was very enjoyable.

I don't have it every week or even every month, but sometimes I just crave it. It is tasty, but I think it is also a comfort food that reminds me of my childhood and simpler times. Since I was a kid, my favorite flavors have been Beefy Pasta and Cheeseburger Macaroni. When we visited my Dad and money was tight, he would just make a box of Kraft Macaroni and Cheese and throw a little browned hamburger meat in it as a cheaper version of Hamburger Helper.<br /><br />I was intrigued to see that Kraft came out with their own version of the trusty old Hamburger Helper meals. As far as I can remember, I don't recall any competition for them in the past.<br /><br />So I ordered a box of the Kraft Velveeta Ultimate Cheeseburger Skillets Dinner Kit. The first difference I noticed right off the bat is that unlike the Hamburger Helper, you don't need to add milk. In fact, the only things you need to add are water and ground beef.<br /><br />Included in the box are the macaroni noodles, a seasoning mix in powder form, and a packet of Velveeta cheese sauce. I call it cheese sauce for lack of a better word, but it is more like a really soft Velveeta than a sauce as it isn't runny.<br /><br />The Kraft Skillets Dinner is a one-pot meal, as with the Hamburger Helper, making cleanup easy. You will need a measuring cup for the water, but using it only for water merely requires drying for the measuring cup, not washing.<br /><br />You begin by browning the ground beef, then you add the water, seasoning mix and macaroni, which is then cooked on a low heat for about 11-13 minutes. Once that stage has completed, you simply squeeze the cheese packet into the pot and stire it until it has melted and mixed into the seasoned sauce. Voila!<br /><br />As for the flavor, it is just as good as the Hamburger Helper. I think I would honestly find it hard to choose between the two products based on flavor. The one deciding factor for me is probably that you don't need to add milk. I don't drink milk, so I don't usually buy it unless I need it for a recipe and most of the carton usually goes bad before I've used it all.<br /><br />I will definitely be buying more of this to keep a box on hand in the pantry.", "dateOfBirth": "2001-07-13", "email": "Lucas.Herrenbrueck@gmail.com"}, {"orcid": "0000-0002-9110-8775", "bio": "My little dog loves Greenies chews!

I expected them to chew off some of the good crunchiness off of it and then leave it alone but no, they really enjoy them.

From their side the calories were pretty close to their claim and the fat content was almost right on, but they didn't use the legal serving size.  They've corrected the label and have to do periodic testing as part of the settlement.  The correction isn't that far from what they originally claimed, but some users of the dressings claim the taste is different, worse, and they must have changed their recipe to make the calories/fat match the labels.  My own experience is that this is still a low-cal dressing and I still really like the taste.  I couldn't really tell a taste difference unless I had an old bottle to compare side-by-side, assuming it is actually different.

Our two cats have been living on various \"high end\" dry cat foods for some time now (e.g., the \"Before Grain\" foods in chicken, tuna and salmon versions, and some fancy pantsy \"Duck a l'orange\" stuff from our local pet shop).  They have not been partial to canned foods, nor have I often gone the canned food route because it is less than convenient and didn't seem worth the candle since they seem to favor dry food (and mice and birds and whatever else they can glean from our little acre in the woods).  They typically start out loving canned food, but after a few bites, the rest sits in the bowl and dries out before we toss it and go back to the dry food they've grown to love.<br /><br />However, both of our cats are smitten by this stuff.  It looks like real food out of the can, with large chunks of fish and seafood in a thickened broth.  It doesn't have the strong fishy smell of most canned foods and looks like something I could almost be tempted to eat my self in a pinch.  The 3 ounce size makes it perfect for a \"treat\" for the cats between feedings of dry food and they leave nothing behind when we dump a can in their dish (with some added hot water as they really love the broth).<br /><br />But I'm not sure I want my cats eating this stuff for the same reason I don't want my eight year old eating at fast food franchises, much as she might love the food and snarf it up in a flash -- I'm concerned this food may not be a healthy thing for the animal eating it or for the planet.

I'm also left to wonder about the source of the fish and seafood in these cans -- is it farm raised in Thailand and if so under what conditions; is it wild fish that may be subject to overfishing and at the very least ought to be feeding hungry humanity rather than going down my cats' gullets; what about mercury and other contaminants in the food?<br /><br />Bottom line: my cats seem to love the stuff, but I'm not sure that will be sufficient to convince me to buy it again.", "dateOfBirth": "2003-03-05", "email": "Matthew.Reed@gmail.com"}, {"orcid": "0000-0002-1112-9323", "bio": "I have been using Molina Vanilla for a number of years as I used to live near the Mexican border and would go to Mexico in person to purchase it.

It's confusing at best. Just how much water to how much powder? It seems that they leave this for us to decide.<br /><br />Then there's the problem with this two-inch wide container. The size and shape may be suitable for stacking on store shelves, but not for home use. You need something wider. Consequently, I transfer the contents into something more sensible. Now I can utilize a measuring spoon, a measuring spoon for the sake of accuracy.<br /><br />Consistent results are what we desire and consistent results require accurate measurements. My dosage being precisely half a teaspoon, I use water (at room temperature) in one measured cup. Directions advise us to heat the water, but I myself do not find that extra chore necessary. I stir and let it settle. Then down the hatch.<br /><br />Need I mention that Natural CALM contains no yeast, dairy, egg, soy, wheat, sugar, starch, preservatives, artificial color or flavors?

They really loved the Happy Hips and Canidae Dog Food and they are great but  I was looking for something as good for them but also a little more cost effective since I have so many poodles...11 of them!  Good thing they are well mannered and trained!<br /><br /> A case of 24 cans of \"CS For The DLS\"  is the price of most cases of 12 cans with other brands. The ingredients are top notch with this one too. [...]<br /><br />One of my tinniest ones, Baby Doll,  gets so excited  and lets out one big yelp whenever we pop open the top tab then she does this little dance around on her back two feet.  It is so cute! I also like that these cans have the pop top lid so I do not have to use the can opener.  I know, the epitome of laziness!  It is a nice feature though.<br /><br />The 4-5 lb. dogs get mostly all can dog food now as their teeth are sooo little.  This canned dog food is specially formulated for seniors but I would guess from reading the ingredients, it could be for all ages. does not have lots of watery juice to take up space but more of a soft/solid form. My larger dogs, up to 12 lbs get mostly the  Bil-Jac mixed with canned.  I mix about half a can with a little water to their Bil-Jac dry food and they graze and eat it up as they feel like it.  This keeps them in shape. They tend not to over eat when they know food is always available. I have always fed my dogs this way and it has always worked. I am going to add glucosamine to it for their hips as a few have problems with hips at their old age.  It is easy to do, just google correct dosage for them then crumble pills and add. Since I have so many dogs, I mix (hide) all meds in a teaspoon with the canned dog food and give it to them individually.<br /><br />I would also like to say that if you have small dogs and /or dogs with problem with their teeth, it is difficult for them to chew the harder kibble. If this happens they will just quit eating except when absolutely necessary and do harm to their health due to tooth pain. Bil-Jac is the only food I have found in dry form with the tiny kibbles which are easily crumbled. There are also dog aspirin formulas you can add, sneak in, to canned food for pain. Don't use unbuffered aspirin for dogs as it is hard on their stomachs. I also add Dr. Katz's water additive to prevent and help tooth and gum problems.<br /><br />My dogs are on an antibiotic regimen ounce a month, first 10 days of month, to help prevent infection from gum disease.  They also have allergies. I was using Benedryl ( at Vet's recommendation) but after researching Zyrtec (generic form), for dogs, I am using that and it works wonders for their allergies. All of the a things I give my dogs are  available on Amazon for a fraction of the price at the drug store.<br /><br /> Please, if you are going to use Benedryl , Zyrtec or any other medication on your dog and cannot afford to go to to the vet, research it completely before doing so and make sure you have the dosage down carefully so you do not harm, or even kill, your pet. It is a very serious undertaking to medicate your dog on your own but can be of tremendous benefit to your pet if you know what you are doing, so research, research, research before doing it!<br /><br />You may ask why I don't take my dogs to the vet for tooth cleaning.  Well, their  are several reasons; one the cost, of course, but the most important is that I do not want my little ones subjected to anesthesia once a year as it is dangerous, hard on their hearts and can cause other problems and even death.  I just make sure they are as pain free and as comfortable as possible in their later years, now.<br /><br />Sorry, I got a little side-tracked!<br /><br />Anyway, I highly recommend this dog food.

The price was very good at the time for what seemed to be decent quality food for the price. It arrived super fast with Prime shipping. I was very impressed that the 15 pound bag had a very sturdy resealable zipper to help reduce the food going stale or needing to put it in a storage container.<br /><br />Unfortunately though, my cats would just not eat this food. I had bought it on a whim since money was tight and I was trying to save a few bucks. I filled up the self feeding container for the cats and they just would not touch it..the food just sat and sat, for literally a week. They had nibbled at it now and then, but did not eat as they do with their regular food. It was like they would eat just a few pieces and that was it.<br /><br />Luckily, one of the cats prefers wet food anyway, so she was still eating daily, but the other cat does not eat wet food and just refused to eat this Good Life Recipe. I was hoping she would come out of being stubborn, or would just get so hungry that she would eat it, but no such luck. I ended up buying our regular food after it was apparent that she would not eat this replacement.<br /><br />A few years back, when this cat food first came on the market, I had received a sample bag of it in the mail. At that time I had another cat who has since passed away, and he ate it just fine. I assume it has a particualr taste or smell that just does not appeal to certain cats. I will say that this food does have a strong smell and oddly enough it sort of reminds me of vomit. This could very well be the reason that some cats do not take to it.<br /><br />Since getting our regular cat food, I tried mixing it half and half with this Goodlife recipen so that I would not be wasting an entire 15lb bag, and the cats would still not eat it. I added more of the regular food, maybe 75/25 and now they seem to be eating it since there is more of the Iams than Goodlife.

Although Cafix tasted the most like real coffee (and it tastes *a lot* like real coffee), and all three products are pretty good, Roastaroma was my favorite.<br /><br />It is very similar to coffee, but it doesn't quite have the bitter bite of coffee. Those of you who are looking for that slight bitterness might prefer Cafix. Roastaroma actually reminds me a little bit of Mexican hot chocolate--the cinnamon and carob flavors come through pretty strongly in the drink, giving it a cinnamon-chocolatey flavor. I used to drink coffee to satisfy my sweet tooth on low calories. This drink totally fits the bill for this purpose.<br /><br />The Pero is pretty good, too. Like Roastaroma, it doesn't have the bitter coffee taste, but it still makes for a decent imitation of decaf. I like to drink it with cinnamon-flavored powdered creamer. Pero's a good value, too: it's strong enough that you don't need to use very much to flavor your whole drink. I drink the Pero when I'm trying to ration the Roastaroma out to myself so as not to run out.<br /><br />So Roastaroma has the best flavor, Cafix tastes the most like coffee, and Pero is a good back-up.<br /><br />A quick note on Postum: I do not care for it.

The container looks something like an old-style stick of deordorant with a plastic ball under the cap that LOOKS like it would roll around, but is actually stationary.  You squeeze the bottle until the gravy-like liquid treat starts to ooze out AROUND the ball and the dog licks it off. If you're not careful (i.e., if you squeeze too hard, esp. if you are treating a small dog like mine), you could end up with a mess on the floor.  That said, it is not difficult to master how hard to squeeze to treat the dog...just be forewarned to squeeze gently until you find the right pressure to use.<br /><br />As you will see in the accompanying video, my dog adores the flavor (I was using the liver flavor Lickety Split in the video).  She whines for it sometimes several times a day (she knows where I keep it).  However, she has a sensitive stomach and I have had to switch over to predominantly allergy-formula food and treats to reduce (and almost eliminate) the frequency of her spit-ups.  The day after I gave her the first taste of Lickety Stik, she spit up for the first time in a few months.  Perhaps that had nothing to do with it and it was something else, but it did make me wary of treating her with this product too often.<br /><br />Note that the packaging says this product is \"All-Natural with Vitamins,\" that there is only \"1 calorie in every 10 licks\" and that there are \"over 500 licks per bottle.\"  The product is made in the USA.<br /><br />I can see where this product would be an excellent one to use for training purposes or on car trips, when you don't want to have to carry a lot of treats with you.<br /><br />Edited 10/11/11 to add that, after reviewing a couple of other reviews, it appears that the rollerball is SUPPOSED to roll, which was my assumption, but it did not on either of the ones I have used (bacon and liver flavors).  I just opened them up and tried to forcibly roll the ball.  I was able to on one but not the other.  Perhaps it varies by container or perhaps it takes a good while of use before the ball starts rolling.

At one point, I had grabbed his Taco Bell bag off the table with the intention of throwing it away to clear space on the table when he snatched the bag and said I almost threw away his green sauce.

My final opinion? Whoop-de-doo! It's got some mild kick (I emphasize mild, because I'm a wuss when it comes to spicy foods and I had no problem with it), which can add a bit of dimension to some bland food, but the sauce itself is borderline tasteless. I tried it on tacos and found it less than thrilling. It added some creaminess, but I think I still prefer adding some good 'ole fashioned salsa to my taco. I then started adding it to random foods to see where it would fit in... As a dip for chicken strips? Nope. Dip for fries? Definitely not. Chip dip? No. As a substitute for mayo on a sandwich? Yeah, it works there. Seeing as it fit best as a sandwich condiment, I'd be more likely to grab this if I saw it in with the mayo than I would be if I was in the Mexican food section at Walmart.<br /><br />Nutritionally, it's not exactly healthy (it's a creamy sauce, what can you expect?) but then again, if you're planning on adding condiments to your Taco Bell Cheesy Gordita Crunch, I'm thinking calorie counting isn't your thing.

I have researched and studied dog foods for several years now and although I believe Canidae is one of better foods out there, Gilligan began having seizures just weeks after he begun eating it and we now home cook his meals.  Gilligan has not had seizures in his lifetime, so we were baffled when all of a sudden he developed a pattern of having a seizure about 3-4 hours after his meal.  His vet said that the pattern made sense to her, because ammonium levels are highest in the blood about 3-4 hours after eating and if the liver doesn't process the protein efficiently, it can definitely cause seizures in the brain.  The day I stopped feeding him the canned food was the last day he had a seizure, and that was about two months ago.  His vet nor I cannot figure out the connection, but my only guess is that it might have something to do with the quality of the meat they use (better than most other brands but still not what humans might consider consumable.)  I must also mention that during this timeframe, Gilligan developed a sinus infection that ultimately we had to have cultured to figure out what it was, and it turns out it was e-coli and the staphococcus bacteria that was up his nose.  Gilligan doesn't have any eyes so when he eats he gets food all over the place (including up his nose), and he was on antibiotics to clear up the infection.  The antibiotics didn't have any effect at all until we stopped feeding him the food (he was on them for about four weeks while eating the food, and about six weeks on his homemade diet.)  Amazingly, the sinus infection began clearing up exponentially after we stopped the canned diet.  He hasn't had any seizures or sinus issues with his home cooked meals, so we won't be going back to Canidae food in the future.

With the whole package in it, it does give it more of a flavor and doesn't taste watered down, but it is still sweet. It has a weird after taste and I taste no honey at all. I do kind of taste the pomegranate but I don't really taste any tea or honey. Every morning I have hot lipton black tea and add honey.

I was surprised that this flavor really seemed like a soup and had real (I'm assuming) pieces of carrot and corn.  It really looks like people food.  He seemed to really enjoy the \"soupy\" broth.  This was his second daily feeding and yet he gulped it down for awhile before wandering off.  He came back later in the evening and finished off the rest.  Success!<br /><br />The next day, I started him with a can of the Sesame Chicken.  It smelled pleasantly like Asian food.  His reaction was to sniff and wander off.  After 12 hours, he hadn't touched it but had eaten a large helping of dry food.  So, he was clearly hungry, but didn't want to touch this flavor.  I washed the remains away and gave him a can of FF:EM.  It was gone within a minute.<br /><br />So, I wondered if he'd just been particularly hungry on the Pot Pie day.  A few mornings later, I did Pot Pie for the morning feeding, and I observed the same behavior.  He drank the broth right away and came back later to finish off the bits.  I also re-tested the Sesame Chicken on a day when I knew he was hungry, and he ignored it steadily.  Clearly, my kitty has preferences.  I have tried some other Petite Cuisine flavors (<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BDDTB2\">Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (Yellowfin, Snapper, Tuna & Sole, Tuna & Shrimp) for Cats, 3-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>) that are available on Amazon.  He will chow down on Tuna & Shrimp flavor but generally doesn't seem to like the other seafood PC flavors (though he will eat them if left with them, unlike the Sesame Chicken reaction).<br /><br />My point is that my cat is picky, and he will eat at least some flavors of this happily even though he's rejected MANY high-quality foods in the past.  It is nice to have an alternative to the one brand.  I'm also happier with him eating this food given the good ingredients and pleasant appearance and scent.<br /><br />I do want to add/note that there are many folks who are mentioning that the food is more liquid than substance.  That is definitely true for the Pot Pie flavor, but it is not true for Petite Cuisine in general.  The Pot Pie is definitely made to resemble soup.", "dateOfBirth": "1976-10-18", "email": "Patrick.Mikalef@gmail.com"}, {"orcid": "0000-0001-9454-8381", "bio": "Not only did this not do anything for me (even after months of drinking it as directed), it also made me tired and sluggish after drinking it.", "dateOfBirth": "1964-11-20", "email": "Patrick.Rein@hotmail.com"}, {"orcid": "0000-0002-4586-5476", "bio": "SeaAloe is a must have for me!

Yes, you can probably get the same effect with a traditional steamer basket, pot, hot water and blender. But that's the beauty of this little machine. It's all 3 things in one which means less clean up too.<br /><br />pros:<br />* EASY TO USE - the beaba babycook is super easy to use. The first couple tries I found myself having to think about each step (measure water level, pour water, align basket, align lid, turn knob to steam) but after a few times, you completely get the hang of it.<br /><br />* LIQUID RESERVES - so one of the best things I found about the beaba is that you can save the liquid from the steaming process and use it to mix in with other foods. For example, whenever I steam apples or pears, I save the liquid that's collected on the bottom and mix it in with oatmeal for an apple/pear oatmeal bowl. This is something that I found I can't do with a traditonal steamer/pot and blender. Any root vegetables, I would discard the liquid (mainly because of my fear of pesticides and such) but everything else, I would keep the liquid and mix it in with foods.<br /><br />* EASY TO CLEAN - the only things you have to clean are the steam basket, blender pot, and lids. They're dishwasher safe too so it can't get any easier than that.<br /><br />cons:<br />* SMALL BASKET - you can only cook a small amount of food at any time. I found that I could only fit around half a potato (diced) at a time. This wasn't a big issue for me because it only takes around 5-6 minutes for the steam to be done. But there were times that I used the traditional steamer basket/pot to steam 2-3 whole potatoes at once (for the freezer) and used the beaba blender to puree.<br /><br />* STAINS - the plastic material is a bit porous so you will see stains (especially from carrots and beets). The plastic steam basket will DEFINITELY stain. Mine is an orangey-color, from the carrots and sweet potatos.<br /><br />* EXPENSIVE - it is quite costly and it's really hard to find these on sale. If you plan on using it for one kid, I would reconsider. If you plan on using it for more than one kid, might be worth the investment.<br /><br />Overall, I'm very glad I made the purchase.

After several trips to the vet and numerous tests that found nothing wrong, we were left thinking that this was her lot in life, sensitive to hairballs with a testy stomach.  We changed her to a vet-recommended food and went on with life, but as you can imagine, she was still suffering.<br /><br />She was dehydrated, her coat was rough, she was losing muscle and constantly hungry because she was essentially living life as a non-voluntary bulimic.  At one point, I hoped a test for her thyroid would be positive so we could just figure out what on earth was wrong with her.<br /><br />Last month I decided I didn't have anything else to lose so I started researching holistic treatments for her various symptoms.  I happened upon a description of grain allergies in cats and I was astounded at the number of symptoms she had.  Her eyes were always watery, her lips and gums a little swollen, and these were things her vet and I had attributed to \"getting older\" or her \"hairball sensitivity\" since none of the test had pinpointed a problem.<br /><br />After some research to select a quality brand, I ordered Wellness Core Dry and Wet food.  I didn't bother to transition her, just started her on it right away.  Besides, she wasn't keeping down much of the other food anyway.  She took to it right away, and she's a picky one.<br />Within two days, the diarrhea was gone.  Within a week, she brought up a hairball that would shame a lesser cat.  It's been a month now and the only bad thing I can say is that I wish I'd found this food sooner.  No more watery eyes, no more swollen lips, and no more noxious fumes from the litter box.  My husband and I cannot believe that fact, but it is true.  A high-quality food WILL reduce litter box odor.  I didn't believe it until I...well...didn't smell it.<br /><br />I'm transitioning our other cat to it now and he already looks better for it.  The food has a stronger odor than store-brand cat food.  You'll also want to note that it doesn't have preservatives, so it's bound to have a stronger smell.  The wet food actually smells good, for cat food.  We use the Wellness Core 3oz Grain-Free Chicken.  I'm sure our experiences will vary, but I've watched a cat who was the epitome of finicky, who would turn her nose up at Fancy Feast if the same flavors were served back to back, gobble the same flavor everyday for the last 30 days without complaint, and most notably, without vomit.  So I'd say she gives her claw of approval.<br /><br />Bottom line?  It's pricy, sure.  But it's worth it for us.

I think the only thing that might be acting as a preservative is the citric acid.<br />Smell - floral and citrus - smells really good.<br />Feel - the chunks are noticeable in the mouth when drinking. Somewhat difficult to drink as the chunks either get stuck in my teeth and block the flow of tea (not joking) or get stuck on the outside of my mouth. Otherwise refreshing.<br />Taste - The chunks are like little explosions of flavor. I am fairly certain that the chunks are aloe vera. The green tea taste is distinct but not overpowering. The passion fruit flavor gives this a very floral taste. Sweet to the taste. Leaves a lingering bitterness/tartness after drinking. Somewhat unpleasant.<br /><br />Overall impressions:<br />This is a relatively low calorie (80) and somewhat refreshing drink. However, the amount of sugar within (and this is a considerable factor) and the related taste associations keep me from giving this more stars. This drink has 19g of sugar, the equivalent of about 1 1/3 tablespoon. It is the second ingredient listed. Granted, some of the sugars may come from the Aloe Vera (or even perhaps the passion fruit flavor?). But based on the Mayo Clinic's analysis of 2010 Dietary recommendations, by having this one drink you've already had over 1/9 of your daily recommended sugar for men, and over 1/6 for women. This is a little disconcerting, in my opinion. When you look at something (especially like tea, and aloe, and passion fruit) like this drink, you think of things that are generally healthy. There's just so much sugar in this that it becomes difficult for me to give this a more positive review.<br /><br />I think that the only redeeming aspect of this is that the calories are not ALL empty calories (like a soda) as you're assumedly getting antioxidants from the green tea - but why not just drink green tea in that case?", "dateOfBirth": "1978-03-02", "email": "Peter.Wolfs@gmail.it"}, {"orcid": "0000-0001-6948-5649", "bio": "The bully sticks are smaller than I thought.

The next day, we have 5.5 oz can of Weruva split between 3 cats, and 1/2 can of the last flavor.  The next day we have another 5.5 oz can, and the remainder of the previous can.

Whenever he yawns or opens his mouth wide, I can see some plaque on his rear teeth.  The vet hasn't said anything bad about that when I've brought it up, but he no longer rips on his rope toys like he used to.  Sure, some of his loss of love for tug of war can be attributed to age, but I think maybe his teeth are a bit weaker too.  I'll update this according to the schedule I laid out at the very top and let you know what happens.  I've also seen lots of reviews online (not about this product, but about dog- and pet-food in general) being made out of sub par or even unhealthy materials.  I'll let you know if my dog's behavior or overall health changes as well.<br /><br />One Week<br />-------<br />My dog is still loving these things.  I feed him in the morning so I like to think these are an evening snack for him.  I don't know what exactly the dental chews are made from, but I'm able to bend the little green toothbrush-shaped chews into a \"U\" and they don't seem to break.  Perhaps it's some kind of gel or gummy chew?  His breath seems a little less \"heavy\".  His teeth seem to be the same. His behavior hasn't changed either, other than being extremely excited to get a chew at night.  This last bit is important to me, because I know some dog treats can be more like dog-crack!<br />See you in a week!<br /><br />Eventually<br />--------<br />Sorry I didn't keep up to my schedule - I think these things work, though not as well as I'd hoped.  My dog still has lots of plaque and buildup on his rear teeth and more disturbingly these things have caused my dog to frequently urinate in my house.  I suspect they are making him drink a lot of water which he can't hold in.  I walk him three times a day and put him outside two to three more times so there's no issue on my end.<br />My ultimate conclusion is that these are just OK.  They aren't damaging to my dog's health... but to say they were helpful in improving his dental situation would be giving these too much credit.<br />My S&S shipments have been cancelled and I'm out looking for a better product.", "dateOfBirth": "1968-02-25", "email": "Qing.Wang@yahoo.com"}, {"orcid": "0000-0002-1700-322X", "bio": "This drink has a great flavor and it does have some energy to it!!

Upon opening the bag I found the litter had a pleasant woodsy-tea odor that was not overpowering. The pellets (they can't be called in any way, shape, or form granules) are lightweight and of a comparable size/consistancy to Yesterday's News cat litter (or rabbit food pellets). Upon pouring the litter into the pan, waves of dust bourgened from the box.  Although the manufacturer describes the product as \"low in dust\", it is anything but.  In fact it's worse than many clay litters. The dust didn't end after the initial pouring either; every time the litter box was scooped, the waves of dust made a reappearance. My poor kitties must have a hard time breathing everytime they dig in this litter, and it's probably one reason why they dislike it so much.  The other likely being the consistancy. The litter does clump well, and the odor control is good, however trying to put myself in the cat's paws I had to pose the question; would I rather walk on a sandy beach, or a rocky one?  The answer is obvious; sand, of course. Hence, it's not a big surprise to find that the cats really do not like this product. There is also alot of tracking of the pellets outside the box due to their light weight and size.  In summation:<br /><br />Pros:<br /> - pleasantly mild woodsy-tea odor<br /> - clumps well<br /> - lightweight<br /><br />Cons:<br /> - hard pellet-sized litter that annoys felines to the point they avoid the box<br /> - high dust<br /> - high tracking<br /><br />If the manufacturer ever makes the pellets into smaller sand-like granules I'd be up for revisiting the product, but for now the cons far outweigh the pros for my household.

No cholesterol.<br /><br />Ah, but how does it taste? If it's like cardboard, it doesn't matter how good it is for you - you're not going to eat it. Luckily, it is rather good! I am *especially* impressed how it tastes nice and salty, but each serving only has 50mg of salt - i.e only 2% of your daily salt intake!! This is incredibly low for a chip or snack food.<br /><br />For other stats, there is 13g of carbs, minus the 4g of fiber leaves 9g of net carbs. There are 8g of fat (1g is saturated) and 140 calories. This is for about 7 large chips.<br /><br />These chips have 6% iron, 2% Vitamin A and 2% calcium. So the serving is not going to give you enough to really worry about skipping your multivitamins, but heck, it's a nice bonus.<br /><br />Now, I don't recommend sitting down and eating your way through an entire bag of these at one sitting :) The whole bag would still give you 90g of carbs, or 1400 calories. That's not a healthy way to get your energy! But there are many times that you want a snack and want something crunchy. Fiber is of course VERY good for you, too. If you have some healthy salsa, it's a good way to get some good veggies into you on a chip base that has very little salt, has good ingredients and is tasty.", "dateOfBirth": "2004-07-15", "email": "Rafiqul.Gani@gmail.com"}, {"orcid": "0000-0002-1840-4965", "bio": "Never a disappointment, always a laugh and since its in blu-ray its a joy too!!!", "dateOfBirth": "1975-06-23", "email": "Rahul.Bindlish@hotmail.com"}, {"orcid": "0000-0003-0421-5028", "bio": "I like strong coffee.

I wanted to replace whey protein with hemp protein to cut down on processed foods for bodybuilding.  The quality of the product was superb and fresh.  Taste-wise, it isn't the best tasting powder in the world, but that can easily be fixed by mixing it with almond milk.<br /><br />After drinking my first shake I noticed a lot of gas and bloating -- which is odd given that this product is supposed to have less bloat than whey.  I figured my body was simply adjusting to the extra fiber and kept taking it for the next month.<br /><br />For the second-third weeks, my body was able to tolerate this stuff relatively well.  However, when I reached the 6-7th week, I started getting severe bloating and stomach pains to the point of vomiting.

I went to the doctor and he gave me a trial of a proton pump inhibitor.  I suspected my GI problems were due to the pre-workout supplement I was taking.  The proton pump inhibitor should allow my digestive system to heal.<br /><br />To rule this product out, I quit taking the hemp and pre-workout supplement for a few days and simply ate more regular food.  I felt better by the weekend.  After those few days, I tried whey protein.  No bloating.  That night, I tried another hemp shake (with almond milk).  One hour after drinking the shake, I got the severe bloating and pain again.. just as bad as before.  I also got the slight headache, chills and ear muscle twitching.

After trying it (along with some of my co-workers whom I shared the case with), we've pretty much come to similar conclusions:<br /><br />PROS - taste is ok, similar to other canned/bottled ice teas like Lipton (but not Snapple).  The tea seems to almost be some kind of energy drink (without it explicitly saying it's an energy drink - there is a warning about high caffeine sensitivity/content on the can).  On the other hand, it does NOT contain so much caffeine (like a Red Bull) that your heart will race.  Everyone that tried it said they felt more alert, but without the jittery/edgy feeling of so-called energy drinks, and without the crash a couple of hours later.  Each can only has 10 calories and the ingredients seem relatively innocuous/not a lot of chemicals.  Price per can works out similar to other energy-type drinks (though way more than soda).  Non-Carbonated.<br /><br />CONS--if you don't like Acai berries' taste, you will probably not like this tea - Acai has a somewhat tart aftertaste - the tea itself is also not terribly remarkable (compared to brands like Snapple and Arizona).  The calorie burning claims are pretty hard to verify - maybe the drink is intended to boost your energy before a workout, so you can work out more effectively?  Cans didn't seem too sturdy - one got punctured in transit, and several got dented (probably more of an issue if you have it shipped; not sure if this is available in stores?).<br /><br />Overall, an ok product, so you'll have to weigh the pro's and con's I mentioned.

He poked around at it a bit though beforehand.<br /><br />He did have much softer, lighter colored stools too, and went to the bathroom more often. The stools did not look like \"healthy\" stools. It was more like a step or two away from diarhea. I hate to sound gross here, but it is important to mention.<br /><br />The bag does clearly depict corn and veggies right on the picture on the front, so I guess it should be no real surprise, but it just seems like Purina was almost trying to pull as fast one on the consumer - make the food sound/look healthy and beneficial even though it is no better than the cheapest generic bag you could possibly find. Also, notice how the picture of the ear of corn is so prominent in comparison to the other items - it is because this dog food is mainly corn, as is with most all cheap/generic brands.<br /><br />For some, this may be suitable, but it is not something that I want my dog to eat regularly.

Miki has been having problems for over a year with the skin just outside of her tear ducts getting red, then raw...poor thing.  Each time I'd take her to the vet, (2 different vets just to see), they  both prescribed the same eye drop medicine ($27.00) for a tiny bottle.  But, it never cleared up entirely, and the minute I'd stop with the drops, after weeks of applying 2-3 x's a day, it would come right back. Looking at her made me feel terrible.<br /><br />Then, I started thinking about maybe it was something she is eating, even though I've been feeding her Ceasar for a couple years and thought it to be a \"good\" dog food.  But after researching what was in Wellness dog food compared to the store bought stuff, I couldn't believe I was feeding her that stuff!<br />So, after doing the math, a 3oz tub of Ceasar vs the 12 1/2 oz can of Wellness, I could get 3 bigger servings (4.1 oz each) out of a can of Wellness...for the same, or better price, and it was way healthier for her!<br /><br />Our Miki looks so pretty again (Papillon) and seems she has a whole lot more energy too! I figure it must be the change in diet that helped clear up her eyes but wasn't sure because we moved at the same time (same town) and I thought it might have been some plants/allergies she was getting into in the back yard.  But....I let myself run out of Wellness (not on purpose!) and had to feed her something else, so I went with the Ceasar and ordered her some more Wellness.  By the time I placed and received my order, (not much more than a week), the skin below her eyes had already broken out again! Ummmm...CONFIRMATION! And guess what?  Within 2 weeks after our Wellness shipment arrived, and she was back eating her favorite dog food, Miki's tear duct area was dried up, rawness gone, and hair was growing back!<br /><br />I don't even remember how I stumbled across this dog food, and who would have ever thought I'd be ordering dog food from Amazon, but with the great price, and free super saver shipping, like I said earlier, it's the same price as that store bought \"stuff\", but she gets more than an ounce more per serving and look at the ingredients...it's real chicken, and sweet potatoes!

Only 1% of magnesium is found in blood, but the body works very hard to keep blood levels of magnesium constant.<br />Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body. It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis.

I love the equal blend of black cherry flavor--light and refreshing, with the light kick of the fizz of carbonation and the bubble feel in my mouth! In fact, that's how Switch bills itself: A perfect balance between juice and carbonation. That's my rave over this new drink.<br /><br />Now here's my reluctance to embrace the drink with five stars. I poured the 8.3 fluid ounces into a small glass (I have a huge collection of mismatched, but adorable clear glasses of all sizes, including this little bowl wine glass I removed from a college cafeteria in France many years ago). The glass held the contents of this tall, thin can of cheery cherry drink perfectly. But wait, by the time I quaffed the contents, I held the glass askance and asked: Is that all? I want more!<br /><br />In comparison my favorite beverage, Zero Sprite, holds 12 fluid ounces, a perfect amount to quench my thirst after a few hours working in the yard. I add ice to Sprite and don't care if it is watered down, but this Black Cherry Switch? No, one does not want to water down this exotic flavor. It must be drunk straight.<br /><br />As for its can slogan: \"100% of what you want and 0% of what you don't,\" I'm not sure about that. Let's examine it. \"What you want\" is \"100% juice, 100% RDA Vitamin C, All natural, Carbonated, Great taste and refreshment.\" I agree with all of those. So far, so good.<br /><br />Let's look at \"what you don't\" want: \"No sugar added, No corn syrup, No preservatives, No artificial colors, and Gluten free.\" True on all those.<br />Next the label. This is where it gets confusing. Total fat 0g, Sodium 15mg, Total Carbs 35g, Sugar 33g, Protein 0g, and 130 calories. The 33 grams of sugar can be confusing. If none was added, then the 33g must come with the natural juice. And Switch does bill itself on 100% juice.<br /><br />In comparison my Sprite can contains 38g of sugar and 140 calories. I thought Zero Sprite contained zero sugar. My bad. I didn't read the label. It is free of caffeine, fat, cholesterol, fiber, Vitamin A and Vitamin C, but no mention of sugar, which I assume comes from the corn syrup.<br /><br />I'm no nutritionist, but it seems that drinking Switch is much better than drinking a Zero Sprite, except that the can is larger so you get more.<br /><br />I would change those four stars to five now, except 8.3 Fl OZ still is not quite enough for one drink.<br /><br />Will I switch? No, but I will add Black Cherry Switch to my fridge for an occasional delightfully refreshing drink when I don't need more. Or else, I will have to trudge up to the headmaster, hold out my cup, and plead: \"May I have more, sir?\"<br /><br />Wouldn't that be embarrassing at my age?", "dateOfBirth": "1971-01-03", "email": "Ryszard.Tadeusiewicz@hotmail.com"}, {"orcid": "0000-0003-0895-3765", "bio": "I was a bit surprised by the previous review, the reviewer obviously didn't do their research.

You will either spend more money on food, or eventually more money on litter materials because feeding a cat regular store bought food with a lot of \"corn meal\" filler creates the smelliest, and fullest litter box around.

The only negative is the maintenance cost, but I figured out the usage for my household and it's virtually the same cost as the Scoop Free system.  It is not an economical system compared to scoopable litter, clay litter, or all natural litter alternatives.  You are paying for convenience and the neatness.  It's really mess-free and I never have to touch the pad, just dump the tray into the trash.<br /><br />I'm confused by some of the poor reviews because it really is a simple system.  Honestly, you'd have to be really drunk or half brain dead to screw it up.  It has to be used as a complete system.  It doesn't work if you try to not use the pads or take some other random cost-cutting measure.  I cannot figure out how the urine pan could leak at all if you are using the pad (right side up with the green plastic side down and the absorbant white side up) and you are changing it when it becomes full.  It functions like a diaper, once the absorbancy has been exhausted, that's it.  You get longer life/better absorbancy if you rotate the tray since cats tend to pee in the same area of the box every time.  If you have multiple cats and one box, or a large cat that pees a lot, you may need to change your pad more often, but that's specific to your cat.  If you are using the box properly with any amount of common sense applied, it will not leak.<br /><br />The bag of pellets is sparse, but that's because it is just supposed to let the urine pass through and give your cat a comfortable environment to allow burying.  The pellets are not meant to absorb the urine, or stick to the poop.  They do recommend that you completely change the pellets every month, so you don't really want to put in more than you need for your cat's comfort.  Both my cats are quite content with one pack.  There is no tracking with these pellets, I rarely find more than two or three pellets on the floor near the box.  I do not find that the pellets remove any odor from the solid waste.  I do notice an odor right after my cat has a bowel movement, or if the box is left longer than day without scooping out the solid waste.  I scoop daily into a litter locker and have no odor in the general areas of the box (unless there is something very fresh).  My pads last a full week, I do have to rotate them once. I have never smelt urine from this box.<br /><br />I do want to point out that because we have two cats and three levels of the house we did add additional boxes per the mfg recommendation (which I thought was crazy initially), however, it really did improve my cats' litter habits.  One cat was using alternative (and undesirable) areas to relieve herself (like my suitcase, laundry basket, etc.)  Once I put in multiple boxes, that behavior completely stopped.<br /><br />We have three boxes for the two cats, one at each level: basement, 1st floor, 2nd floor.  The pads generally last at least a week for all boxes, occasionally one box will be used less and a pad will last two weeks.  The pellets are still odor free after 6 weeks.  I agree that the refill costs are high, but as I said, comparable with the ScoopFree system, but this was actually cleaner and easier given the unique habits of my cats.

It can replace those nasty \"fruit flavored\" roll ups and \"fruit snacks\" that are made primarily of corn syrup and artificial color and usually no fruit at all.  The twisted fruit rope is made out of actual furit, and even provides one serving per rope.  The ingredients are simple: apple puree, apple juice concentrate (makes it sweet), flavors, pectin, and fruit and vegetable colorings.  None of the chemicals from those bright \"fruit flavored\" concoctions, and everything is organic!<br /><br />The taste is great, too.  It's a bit tart, but with a nice berry flavor.  The texture is chewy, and it looks, tastes, and feels like a big Twizzler.  The ropes are packaged individually to throw in lunch boxes or backpacks, but I found myself reaching for at least 2 at a time.<br /><br />There are a couple of things I didn't like.  The strips are a little sticky;  it helps if you hold them by the wrapper instead of taking them out.  The sugar is also still fairly high.  There are 9 grams of sugar, a whopping 45% out of each 20 gram rope.  It's not added refined sugar, but the sugar comes from apple juice concentrate, which is much sweeter than natural apple juice.  Combine that with the sticky nature of the product and it's probably a good idea to have your kids rinse their teeth after eating one.<br /><br />Those drawbacks aside, these snacks remain far superior to candy or those gooey little \"fruit snacks\" as a tasty treat for kids (or adults!).

I have a bread machine, but hadn't used it it a long while (like many folks, I suspect). Plus, I have been watching carbs but I love bread. If you are a fan of low-carb bread (if it's possible to be a fan of anything low-carb), I think you will enjoy this product.  It produces a large loaf of fluffy, light but a bit chewy bread -- great for slicing or tearing up by hand.  It has a nice wheaty taste and doesn't have that cardboardy consistency/taste that many low-carb products have. It uses half-and-half as one of its ingredients, which I think makes it fluffy.  My only quibble: I have a two-pound bread machine and the bread consistently overflows the top of the machine at the end of the baking cycle -- creating a mushroom-like top to the loaf. So, the top is a bit underdone. I am going to try baking it in the regular oven the next time and see if that is better.  Again, Bob's Red Mill products aren't cheap, but they are very high quality and the four packages produce four large loaves of bread that stay fresh for quite a while and travel well.

I had this for lunch today with a peas/carrot/corn organic veggie combo mixed in, and it was tasty and filling.<br /><br />Here's my opinion: The heat/hotness level (ie, the heat) is about mediumish. Maybe a bit to the mild side of medium. But it does have some heat, so know that. It's got good spicing, so it packs a flavor punch. There is a lovely creaminess, a thick creaminess, so you can water it down (as I do) to make soup or you can leave it thick to pour over rice or use naan to sop it up.<br /><br />My only critique is that the dumplings are not very dumplingey as I have previously experienced \"dumplingness\". They are, if I had to describe the texture/taste, like tiny baked potatoes. As if you cooked dumpling sized potatoes to a nice soft-firmness. But that's it. Like chunks of potato, not like dumplings (which I've had as airy and as chewy, depending).<br /><br />Since this is essentially just the potatoes and spiced milky-creamy base,  you can vary this in many ways by adding meats, veggies, thinning with milk or water, or topping with crispy bits (baked pita, croutons, etc) or bacon or cheese. Very versatile. This would totally rock with chicken pieces and peas, which is what I'll be making next with the Karhi. I will also try with spinach mixed in.<br /><br />For those watching their weight, this whole can is less than 300 calories worth of damage. :) And each serving has 70 calories (a can is four servings).<br /><br />This is the second Jyoti product offered on Amazon that I've tried.

For those of you who have not tried Prime membership it pays for itself in between 60-90 days with moderate use and I believe Amazon still offers a 30 day free trial which is worth looking at to experience the benefits.

The normal K-cups are all plastic while these have a plastic ring with a fiber filter bag. Its not 100% recyclable but its a big step forward as the filter will break down quickly and the coffee grounds will then fall out allowing those to decompose as well. That leaves a small plastic ring (which looks recyclable) and foil top left. To assist to keep your coffee fresh you receive a reusable lightweight recyclable plastic tub with an airtight lid that holds about 8 K-cups for peak freshness.

Unfortunately, the two varieties I have tried have been a real disappointment.  Like the Black Bean Jalapenos, the Tortilla y Pollo's seasoning is heavy on the chili powder and not much else.  Although a bit milder than the Black Bean Jalapenos, the Tortilla soup's broth is really little different in taste or consistency.<br /><br />There is little in the way of meat or vegetables in this particular soup which caused me to rate the product as deserving only two stars.  The can I opened had about six pieces of chicken, each measuring about 3/4\" X 1/4\" X 1/4\"; a handful of black beans, a few corn kernals, and a piece or two of pepper.  I found this soup to be a significant departure from Progresso's usual quality ingredients and flavor combinations.<br /><br />In producing this soup, Progresso has committed a common error - assuming the flavors of Mexico and Tex-Mex foods are limited to chili powder; in the case of the Tortilla soup, there were not even pieces of jalapeno pepper thrown in to lend \"authenticity\" to the product.  I suggest Progresso review \"Los Barrios Family Cookbook: Tex-Mex Recipes from the Heart of San Antonio\" by Diana Barrios Trevino for the true flavors of Tex-Mex cooking. If attempting to produce a soup which reflects only Mexico's flavors, then Rick Bayless' \"Authentic Mexican: 20th Anniversary Edition: Regional Cooking from the Heart of Mexico\" would be an excellent resource for Progresso to use.<br /><br />If you are looking for a soup that combines interesting layers of flavor and multiple ingredients, you would do well to look elsewhere. This soup reflects neither the flavors of Tex-Mex cooking or Mexican cooking.

That way we would be able to save some money and the earth a little bit as well.<br /><br />Then, I realized I could potentially skip the pee pads entirely and just replace our toilet training system with the Breeze litter box...on top of the toilet, sans tray (and toilet seat/lid/mounting parts).  This is exactly what I did this morning when I received the system, and the kitties were ecstatic not to have to use the wretched toilet training system anymore.  They took to it immediately... probably because they were glad to go back to a litter box and also because we had been using Feline Pine with them, so they were used to pellet-type litter.  So we're all happy... the kitties are peeing in the toilet, although they don't know it, and all we have to do is scoop the poo, which doesn't smell as bad when the kitties bury it.<br /><br />I was really hoping they would be able to use the toilet on their own, but I think we've reached a pretty good compromise.

Two types of basil is just overkill when there is a separate basil kit.<br /><br />With that said, the green basil grows really fast.  It was ready to harvest within three weeks.  The purple basil is the next best, followed by the mint and the oregano.<br /><br />The chives are the most delicate -- they dislodge and curl back into the sponge.

I called the company and they shipped me a replacement, which also never sprouted.<br /><br />I can't wait for the new herb varieties to arrive in September.

It's unfortunate that some herbs work really well and others don't.<br /><br />Revised 10/13/06:  I spoke with someone in cusotmer service last week.

The previous times I ordered flowers through Amazon, I was given options to select the delivery date, as well as what to say on the card.  This vendor had no such options.  During the order process I was informed it would take 1 to 3 business days.  Since I was ordering in advance, 1 to 3 days was enough.  3 days would be on-time, and one day would make my wife happy as she would get to enjoy them for the whole week...<br /><br />4 days after placing the order, the tracking status shows that the delivery estimate was changed to 2 to 10 days.  Worse, the tracking info indicated the shipper (fedex) was holding the order back, but I could go pick it up if I wanted.  Keep in mind that I'm shipping it to an office building that gets fed-ex shipments daily.  Apparently they shipped with a super-low-priority option allowing the shipper to delay the shipment.<br /><br />Sure, I could go pick them up 35 miles away at the FedEx warehouse, and drive to the opposite side of town to deliver them myself...  Of course the reason I ordered delivered flowers was because I wanted to pay someone else to deliver them for me.  I wouldn't mail-order flowers that I can buy at the grocery store, if I planned to deliver them myself.<br /><br />So here I sit, a week after I placed the order, wondering if they might be delivered soon...  With amazon telling me that, for sure, they will be there by next week.<br /><br />So what kind of condition will roses be in after a week and a half being tossed around in a cardboard box?  And I paid for this?<br /><br />There are 123 florists in this town, and they all are affiliated with 1 or more florist delivery networks.  So getting flowers delivered fresh from a florist should never need to involve Fed-ex.  But I guess I get what I paid for, if I wanted real service, I should have paid a real florist for real florist service (or do it myself).<br /><br />I'm sure that my bad experience is partially because of my own high expectations from having used flower services for the last 20 years, always getting next day (or same day) delivery of my orders.  The last time Amazon forced me into 2-day delivery expectations, which was ok as that was explained up-front and I got exactly that.<br /><br />But this time I was promised 1-3 days before I was charged, then promised 2-10 days after it was too late to make a different choice.  That is called bait and switch.  Perhaps the delivery estimate provided by Amazon is not based on the original representation in the shopping card, but that wouldn't matter if the item had arrived on time.  Perhaps it is all FedEx's fault...  But that is what is being sold, so the delivery service is part of what is being sold...  So even if the seller is blame-free for my poor experience, it is the sum of my experience<br />with the vendor AND the delivery service that counts toward my ability to enjoy my purchase.<br /><br />I would suggest avoiding this vendor.

Every bite is super crunchy.<br /><br />I have tried it in milk, but didn't really like it that way. Instead, I use a fruit variety of kefir, which is sort of like a creamy yogurt drink. I've tried Ezekiel with peach, pomegranite and mixed berry kefir varieties, and it is a tasty combination. If you want to try this, keep in mind that kefir is a bit thicker than milk. I prefer just enough kefir to moisten the cereal so that the grains remain the star of the show.<br /><br />Ezekiel is a very healthy cereal, perhaps the healthiest one available.

Straight-out-of-the-box Ezekiel with milk probably is hard core cold turkey if you're reforming from bad eating habits (like I am!).

I definitely drink too much of it, but it's one of the last I-know-how-bad-it-is-for-me things I allow myself in a time when most of the foods and drinks you see in the supermarket can best be described as \"mild poison.\" Books and documentaries keep popping up telling us just how bad the foods are that we consume (Supersize Me, Fast Food Nation, The Omnivore's Dilemma, etc.), and one of the big offenders is the insidious high fructose corn syrup. They put it in everything, it seems, especially beverages. (Its worst aspect is that it blocks the receptors in your brain that tell you you're full and should stop eating or drinking, so you continue feeling hungry and eating and drinking more and more.) So it's refreshing to have a drink that's got a nice sweet flavor without this awful sweetener. Tastes will vary, but I found this pretty nice, and pomegranate's a flavor you don't normally see as a soda - or, \"sparkling juice\" - so I'd say this is worth a try. At the very least, it's more interesting than another boring ol' cola or lemon-lime soft drink.<br /><br />A note on the Clementine variety:<br />These Izze drinks are really quite nice. In addition to the lack of high fructose corn syrup, which is a major plus, they use really interesting flavors. This clementine flavored sparkling juice is cool variation. I thought it might taste more like a Sunkist-style orange soda, but it really doesn't. The clementine flavor is very distinctive. I don't think I've ever had a soda quite like it. Tastes great, very tangy, not nearly as sweet as I would have expected.

I only say this because if you are expecting a rich, moist, creamy dessert then you will be sorely disappointed. But as far as a protein bar goes, this is pretty good tasting.<br /><br />I would argue that the nutrition is near perfect. Each brownie has 20 grams of protein, 38 grams of carbs, and 6 grams of fat. If your eating this as a supplement to body building (and I assume you are) then you would have difficulty saying that there is too much fat or too many carbs when comparing it to an ideal diet. And if your eating several meals per day (shame on you if your not) its no problem at all to alter one of the meals for the daily desired amount of fat and carbs. The only real complaint I have about the nutrition is that there is 24 grams of sugar per brownie which is a little high.<br /><br />The taste is great, it taste like a brownie. Its drizzled in an icing (probably where alot of the sugar comes from) which really enhances the flavor. The texture, however, is fairly grainy and dry. This is to be expected as it is meant to be \"healthy\" and as a supplement.<br /><br />The price is fair, 2 dollars a brownie on amazon and 2.50+ in the store.

Trying to be health conscious and trying to avoid fats, I was looking for snacks that would satisfy both requirements.  I stumbled on these snacks at two (2) places: Dean's Natural Foods stores and Whole Foods.<br /><br />Be careful that you only select the Glenny's that say Low Fat on the label. Why? This is important if you are trying to cut fat out of your diet as well as calories.  There are no saturated fats nor any trans fats nor any cholesterol in the low fat Glennys.  There is only one gram of fat per serving.  And the calorie count is extremely low (only 70 calories per serving) versus for the regular Glennys over 110 to 120 calories per serving.<br /><br />The taste is great and for those who need a crunchy snack sometime during the day; this is a healthy alternative to potato chips or pop corn.  Two small servings which would only be 140 calories and 0 saturated fat would provide you with 10 grams of soy protein, 25 mg of soy isoflavones, 3 grams of dietary fiber and more soy protein than tofu or soy milk.<br /><br />Cosmopolitan Magazine quotes: \"Even better than potato chips. Delicious.\"<br /><br />Additionally, each serving gives you 4% of your daily calcium requirement and 8% of your iron percent daily value. Each serving would be about 10 chips approximately.  I open the 3 ounce bag and separate the contents into ziplock bags (10 chips apiece) so that I can regulate the calories and the amount of fat in my snacks.<br /><br />What is nice for those who are afraid to buy a 3 ounce bag of anything.  Even if you succumbed to eating the entire 3 ounce bag: all would not be lost.  You would be getting 20 grams of protein, 50 mg or soy isoflavones, 6 grams of dietary fiber and 300 calories total in the whole bag.  The taste is great whether you purchase the low fat apple cinnamon, the white cheddar or the lightly salted, the low fat barbeque...all have a great taste.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this snack..great taste.<br /><br />Sample a bag.  I think you will be a fan after that.<br /><br />The 1.3 ounce bags (which are being offered on Amazon) are even better than the 3 ounce (85 gram) bags that I have been purchasing.

The furthest point from the charger measured 800V so my wiring is pretty good now I'd say.  Still, the dogs dug under the wire and got out the next day.  One is a longer haired dog and the other is short ... either stupid or it wasn't enough voltage - probably a combination of both.<br /><br />So, I'm hoping that even though that Fi-Shock owns Zareba, that it doesn't affect how Zareba makes their fence chargers.  I ended up returning the SS-550X and going with the 20 acre Zareba charger - a couple bucks cheaper but hoping it works at least as good as the 10 acre I had.<br /><br />Because it isn't putting out it's advertised voltage of 1200V, I assume either it's not working 100% or the description is slightly off.

It comes in a plastic squeeze bottle, and all you do is give a single squeeze into each 8 oz. of water. Be sure to shake well before each squeeze, and in my experience even when I had the cap open (I did this right over a sink to avoid any accidents) and shook it vigorously, none of the liquid came out. It actually has to be squeezed to come out, or at least mine did. The fruit punch tastes fine, and depending on how much you are actually putting in the flavor can be very, very subtle or fairly detectable. What it basically comes down to is about the level of Vitamin Water or Gatorade in terms of how prominent the taste is. In my opinion it tastes a little sweeter and a little tastier than those. Because you're squeezing it into water, that's a pretty good analogy to think of how it tastes: this is just a slightly sweeter version of Vitamin Water. With each serving (single squeeze) you'll get 120% of your daily Vitamin C and 40% each of Vitamins B3, B5, B6, and B12. The great thing is that it also has 0 Calories and 0 grams of sugar. That's right...no sugar. You also get 40 mg of natural caffeine, 10 mg of taurine, and electrolytes. Compare that to Gatorade or Vitamin Water and suddenly this is looking really good if you want to cut down on your sugar intake; take a look at one of those bottles next time, I was shocked to see how much sugar is in them. Personally I do not get any extra noticeable energy from the caffeine, but I am notoriously resistant to energy stuff. I don't drink tea or coffee, although I do have roughly a one-can-per-day cream soda habit, and I'm guessing that my relative lack of daily caffeine is what makes it so hard for any energy supplements to work on me...or maybe that's just me. Anyway, take a look at a can of cream soda and you'll find that unfortunately one can exceeds the daily recommendation of sugar intake. I'm happy and proud to say that over the last week or so that I've had this squeeze bottle, I have only had one can of soda and have opted instead the other times to get a glass of water and squeeze some of this enhancer into it when I'm craving a sweet beverage. Will it get me off cream soda? No, I don't want it to. I love cream soda and I do still wan to have a delicious can from time to time.

From Knudsens to After the Fall, to Flavored Vitamin Waters without the carbonation, my family has tried all kinds of different flavors and types of carbonated and non-carbonated drinks with no refined sugars added.<br /><br />IZZE Sparkling Clemintine Juice is made of 70% fruit juice with added vitamins such as B6, Beta Carotene, Niacinimide, and vitamin C.  I am not sure what the *natural flavors* added are, as this is often a hiding place for ingredients with some companies that do not want you to know little things they sneak in.<br /><br />Flavorwise, IZZE Sparkling Clemintine Juice is very good.  It is made from concentrate so there is not the fresh flavor that you would get from fresh juice, but I find that this juice only has a tiny bit of bitter edge to it- nothing like most orange flavored juice beverages we have had.<br /><br />What impresses us about this is that it is not overly syrupy like some juices are.  It takes very light, yet filling.<br /><br />Another feature of this drink is that the bubbles are not heavy and the carbonation is not overly strong.  Sometimes drinks have so much carbonation in them that they are annoying.  This one has light to medium carbonation in it.<br /><br />One additional thing I like about this is that the cans are relatively small (8.4oz/248ml).  I have never liked the huge can sizes because I feel that you should only drink small amounts of cooked juice products at a time anyway.<br /><br />There are 24 in the case, which is a good number.  We drank this warm without ice, but chilled it is also delicious.  It tends to go down a bit easier when it is chilled.<br /><br />With ice, it is an even lighter drink and bit more refreshing as the ice dilutes it leaving just a hint of orange flavor.<br /><br />All in all, IZZE Sparkling Clemintine Juice is a hit in our house.

Few taste better and none are easier than what comes in this box. It's the only store-bought mix I've seen that requires six eggs. Probably not the healthiest thing in the world, but it tastes fabulous. I make these every other weekend. The only trick is to add the dry ingredients slowly, using a whisk to blend them with the liquids. Then, let it stand for five minutes and give one final, vigorous stir before cooking. The resulting crepes are light and delicious. If you make too much you can only store them in the fridge for about a day, two at the outside. Even though they separate a bit, vigorous stirring will reblend them to the point that they will cook just fine even if they don't look as good as they did straight out the box.<br /><br />Suggested fillings:<br /><br />My favorite is a warm banana filling. Make 2 1/2 cups of simple syrup (water and sugar) in a non-stick pan. Add six thinly sliced bananas, a tablespoon of bourbon vanilla, and three teaspoons of pumpkin spice mix (blend of cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice). Cook over medium heat for around four or five minutes until the liquid reduces and the bananas barely begin to get mushy. Splash in a little cr&egrave;me de banana liquor to finish, stir once, and serve. The easiest way to fill the crepe is to place it on a plate, spoon the filling into the center, and fold in both sides.

I was first introduced to John McCann's Oatmeal when I decided to quit eating rolled oats because of their texture and the inspiration of watching the episode of \"GOOD EATS\" featuring steel cut or pinhead or Irish oats. I originally found these oats at my local market and found them to be delicious, although, they do take awhile to properly cook they are by far the best option in terms of flavor, nutrition and texture. Their flavor is similar to brown rice while still having a bit of a \"wheaty\" taste. They are very nutritious, but as most nutritious foods are, they must be portioned because of their high calorie content, (I find that half a cup, 300 calories, is the perfect amount) although they are very good for fighting cholesterol and the fat they contain is \"good\" fat. Their texture is also similar to brown rice, but softer and creamier if prepared in such a fashion. I make my oats two ways, on the weekdays I make them in a rice cooker overnight which produces a piping hot bowl of deliciousness and on the weekends I take my time and prepare them on the stove top. They really are a delicious way to start my day and I look forward to enjoying a bowl every morning. Being that I eat pinhead oats everyday I found that buying these tins was beginning to get quite expensive, so one day I went to a bulk foods market and bought a pound of bulk steel cut oats thinking they would be a lower quality and good for the weekdays. Since then I have done numerous side-by-side comparisons of the two and they are exactly the same in taste and texture, making paying double for John McCann's Oats a delicious, but obsolete choice nonetheless.<br /><br />Pros: Delicious, nutritious, and the tin is re usable.<br />Cons: Somewhat expensive when compared to bulk options.<br />Overall: Buy these if you aren't going to be eating them everyday; they are delicious and well worth the money.<br /><br />I cook my steel cut oats on the stove top thusly:<br />1/2 cup steel cut oats<br />1 tbsp unsalted butter<br />2 cup water (boiling)<br />1/2 cup milk<br />1 pinch of kosher salt<br />2 tsp sweetener (brown sugar, honey, or maple syrup)<br /><br />Take a 12\" sauce pan (or something comparable) with a lid and turn heat to medium, add butter, let melt and add oats. The idea here is to roast the oats. Be sure to shake the pan around every minute or so to keep the oats from burning. After about three to four minutes or until the oats smell toasty add the boiling water and drop the heat to low and cover. Let sit for thirty minutes and slowly stir the oats every five minutes until done. After thirty minutes has elapsed add milk, salt and sweetener stir until combined (If a more creamy mixture is desired add more milk or cream to oats).

Also, compared to the other food, it doesn't not smell very attractive (to a cat, I assume). I can barely smell it at all. While I like that, my cat doesn't seem to think it's food. He did eat some last night, but he still meows at me for the other food when I try to give this to him. He picks out his old food if I mix the two.

None of the flavors are overpowering yet all of them are present.  The beverage is only 5 calories a serving and has no caffeine, which is alright in my book.
